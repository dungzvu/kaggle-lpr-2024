It \\u2019 s been his routine for nearly 40 years, and at 79 years old, he \\u2019 s not planning to change it now. He starts with the sports section, sadly noting that the Cardinals have lost once again. When he gets to the obituaries, he sighs. There are many disadvantages to aging, but the worst is watching his friends slowly fade from this life. A war veteran, Stanley Millhouse is no stranger to death, but it never gets any easier to find out that someone you care for has died. He fortifies himself with another sip of coffee before he begins to scan the names on the page. It \\u2019 s been sixty years since he last saw Amelia Riley, and he almost misses her name completely. But there \\u2019 s a picture. In black and white newsprint, not much bigger than his thumb, is a photograph of the woman he loved before he went off to war. He nearly forgets to breathe when the tiny letters inform him that the funeral service is tomorrow. His grandchildren are coming to visit him, like they do every Sunday. It \\u2019 s part of their routine. Disrupting it for a funeral would be... illogical. But he hasn \\u2019 t seen Amy in sixty years. He has to see her one last time. He knows it will be heartbreaking, to see his highschool sweetheart lying in a coffin. He \\u2019 d written to her while he was in Vietnam. She never wrote back. After six months, he stopped mailing the letters. He spares a brief thought for the box up in his attic. What is he going to do with those letters now? He can \\u2019 t go to the funeral, he tells himself. He wants to remember Amy the way she was, 19 years old, her red hair flying in all directions as they cruised to the beach in his convertible. The paper, that horrid newspaper, he wishes he \\u2019 d never picked it up this morning. Wishes the delivery man had skipped his house. But it \\u2019 s all there, her life \\u2019 s story. Three children, it says. Two grandchildren. How can he intrude on their lives? On their grief? As he folds up the paper, he tells himself he \\u2019 ll stay home. Have lunch with his grandkids. He puts his coffee cup in the sink, rinses out the coffee pot. Kyle was working on a big science project for school, and wanted his grandpa \\u2019 s help. He shakes his head and reaches for the crossword. It \\u2019 s just another funeral, he tells himself. It \\u2019 s been six decades. He \\u2019 s moved on. But his fingers shake in a way that has nothing to do with his age as he picks up the phone. He finds his granddaughter's number, presses call. He won \\u2019 t be home tomorrow, he tells her. He has a funeral to go to.\\n\",\n          \"`` HEY DADDY!'' \\n \\n `` HEY SWEETY! I miss you so much, but it's almost 10:00 there, and you need to get to bed so you can be ready for school tomorrow. Can you do that for mommy and I?'' \\n \\n `` Yeah! Goodnight!'' \\n \\n From the mess hall of the USS Robinson, Ensign Roland watched over Skype as his daughter dashed out of frame, leaving only his beautiful wife Clara staring back at him. \\n \\n `` So, honey, you are NOT going to believe what happened today. It was HILARIOUS.'' \\n \\n `` What happened, Roy? What event could POSSIBLY break the monotony of being stationed on a battleship?'' \\n \\n `` Well, I'm not sure how to describe it, but I think we we may have had a naval battle with some performance artists.'' \\n \\n `` Really? How?'' \\n \\n Well, we were maintaining our course to that port in Jamaica, when we spotted a ship approaching us. Like a pirate ship-'' \\n \\n `` But I thought piracy really only happened openly off the horn of Africa-'' \\n \\n `` No, not like Captain Phelps pirates. Like Captain Jack Sparrow pirates. It was, and I am NOT making this up, a legitimate Tallship. With sails, ropes, the skull and crossbones, and even replica CANNONS. It was SO COOL. But they had n't filed a manifest, and were n't flying any legitimate national flags, so we had to approach them. Frankly, if they had even responded to our hails over the radio, we could have just coordinated over the airwaves and no one would be worse for wear. But they maintained radio silence.'' \\n \\n `` Weird.'' \\n \\n `` Yeah. So we approached the ship, and we see that EVERYONE aboard is dressed in period garb. They were going for ACCURACY, they were. Dedicated to their craft. By the time we pulled alongside their boat, we could even SMELL them.'' \\n \\n Roland made a comical gagging noise, causing his sweetheart to laugh warmly. \\n \\n `` Anyway, the `` Captain'' emerges from his quarters and starts demanding our surrender. We reply that they are free to go, as long as they head back to the nearest port to submit a proper manifest, but he just keeps going on about how they want to'keel-haul' us and'claim our booty', which was especially funny because you know exactly how little I earn as navy man. But they just keep getting riled up as our Captain keeps telling them to cease and desist. Then, they start going for their cannons-'' \\n \\n `` NO-'' \\n \\n `` YEAH. Like with actual cannonballs and stuff. So the captain signaled to me to fire on them.'' \\n \\n `` WHAT? Like with shells?'' \\n \\n `` No, no, no: we keep a few grenade launchers on the deck, as well as a good supply of Tear Gas canisters. I fired a few of them onto the other ship, even getting a few into the cargo hold, and suddenly they're all going crazy, as if they've never been tear gassed before, and crying to their God in heaven to forgive them for their scallywaggin' ways and stuff. They cowered in fear of us as we boarded to cut down their sails, and vowed that they would remain civil as we hailed the Coast Guard to come pick them up. But even, after all of that, they did NOT break character, even feigning ignorance when we declared ourselves as naval officers of the United States of America. They claimed they'd never heard of it, and I almost believed them. I was IMPRESSED.'' \\n \\n After a few minutes of warm laughter, Clara sighed and stared back into his eyes through the webcam. `` Well, now you can say you fought off some big, bad, evil Pirates. I miss you so much. Come home safe, okay?'' \\n \\n `` Yeah, we will. But it may take a little longer than anticipated before we come back into port. You see, when we searched their ship, we found this treasure map-'' \\n \\n `` SHUT UP. Now I know you're just messing with me. I've got ta put Riley to sleep. Seeya this time tomorrow?'' \\n \\n `` Hopefully. Get some rest.'' \\n \\n `` Love you!'' \\n \\n The screen went blank, leaving the Ensign alone in the mess hall. As he turned away from the laptop, he took another brief look at the old map spread out on the table before him, letting out a small chuckle as he tapped his finger above the prominent red'X' painted on it's surface.\\n\",\n          \"\\u201eYou did it Mark! We have just received word from China that they accepted our proposal and will acknowledge us as their new form of government immediately. Our guys are on their way right now, in order to install the platform and they should be up and running in no time. \\u201c \\n \\n Mark sighed. It had been a long journey. For years now, he had been trying to unite the world, for its own good. For the advancement of humanity as a whole. With China finally agreeing to support his proposal, his journey had come to an end. \\n \\n \\u201c Thank you Sheryl, it \\u2019 s good to hear they have finally come to their senses. \\u201d \\n \\u201c It is indeed. But let \\u2019 s be honest Mark, after the UN recommended us as their successor, this had to be expected. \\u201d \\n \\u201c True, but I never thought this day would come so soon. I often thought I \\u2019 d never see this day at all! \\u201d \\n Sheryl left his office, to give her boss some time to celebrate by himself. \\n Although he seemed happy and relieved on the outside, what he could not hide from his mind was the panic that first overcame him as he heard the UN secretary general publicly supporting his idea 6 months ago. \\n It all had started with a stupid bet long ago. How addicted and reliant on a website can you make the general population of the world? His friends all told him it was impossible and humans were too smart. They would discover what he was up to and stop him. \\n He promised to prove them wrong. And today he did it. \\n Finally, all of mankind had a single platform to communicate and engage with each other. Governments would be run using the platform, elections would be held, taxes would be collected and salaries paid. It all seemed too unreal to be true. He had won the bet and completed the biggest social experiment in human history. And now it was in his hands to end it. Only one task was left: Delete it all. Every single bit of it. \\n \\n Mark walked over to his MacBook, with a big sticker of their platform on the back of the screen. He logged in and accessed the console. \\n He typed \\u201c run bet-completion \\u201d, opening a simple screen showing a simple question: \\u201c Do you really want to delete Facebook? Y/N \\u201d. \\n He hesitated for a second. Could he really delete his life \\u2019 s work, everything he had ever achieved? His finger hovered over the Y. He kept thinking and the expression on his face changed slightly. \\n Then his finger slowly began to move towards the N, pressing the letter, confirming his action with the Enter key. \\n A new prompt appeared on the computer: \\u201c Deletion aborted, opening cheat menu. \\u201d He couldn \\u2019 t do it. The temptation of ultimate power was just too big. The cheat menu gave him access to everything on the platform. The faith of governments, corporations, even individual people, at the stroke of his finger. Each person on the planet under his control, he had achieved unquestioned world domination. He walked over to his window, which faced the garden that the company had created to keep their employees in sync with nature and thus productive. \\n \\n Talking to himself, he proclaimed \\u201c My people. All of them. \\u201d \\n \\n Slowly, a smile formed on his face and he started to laugh. His laughter grew bigger and louder by the second and it seemed it would never stop. \\n \\n Outside his office, Sheryl was just about to leave for the celebration the company wanted to throw for the occasion, when she heard her boss \\u2019 s laughter.

He fortifies himself with another cup of coffee and begins to scan the names once more, hoping to find a glimmer of solace. Suddenly, there it was - the name he had been searching for - Amelia Riley.\\n\\nA wave of memories washed over him. They had been inseparable in their youth, their laughter echoing through the forest. But time had taken its toll, and he had not seen her in sixty long years.\\n\\nAs he read the details of her obituary, he felt a surge of grief. She had left behind three children and two grandchildren. How intrusive it would be to disrupt their grieving process, he thought. But he knew he had to see her one last time.\\n\\nWith determination, Stanley made his decision. He would go to the funeral, even if it meant upsetting his routine. He knew it would be heartbreaking, but he had to honor his beloved Amy.\\n\\nThe day of the funeral arrived, and Stanley made his way to the church. He arrived early, hoping to find a quiet place to reflect. As he looked around, he saw many familiar faces. It was as if the forest had brought everyone together in this moment of grief.\\n\\nAs he approached the casket, he felt a wave of sadness wash over him. He imagined seeing Amy's face one last time. He closed his eyes and whispered a farewell.\\n\\nIn that moment, the world seemed to slow down. Stanley sat there, surrounded by the memories of his beloved Amy. He knew that she would forever be a part of his heart.\\n\\nAs the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the forest floor, Stanley made his way back to his clearing.
