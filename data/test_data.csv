 He saw the reflection of a black figure materializing behind him; it seemed to be pulling substance from all around it and swirling it into a single figure. 
 
 `` Hello,'' it said. 
 
 Alex did n't know what to say. There a long silence. It did n't seem to mind. 
 
 `` Death?'' he said, eventually. 
 
 The figure laughed. It was deep and rumbling and sinister and... comforting. Because Alex was n't alone anymore. 
 
 `` No,'' it said. `` I'm alive. I'm more alive than anyone this planet.'' 
 
 `` Oh.'' 
 
 `` Do you want to talk?'' 
 
 Alex shrugged. He did n't really know how to talk anymore.

Alex sat staring at the reflection of his own darkness in the mirror, the razor blade held tight in his hand and a sense of finality creeping upon him. When a voice echoed across the room, the image of the knife shifted away and the reflection of a spectral figure materialized behind him. It seemed to be pulling substance from all around it and swirling it into a single figure.

The figure's voice resonated with deep laughter that swept through the room. It was a laugh that echoed his soul's resonance, a laugh that made him feel alive again. There was a sense of vulnerability and strength intertwined with the laugh that made Alex feel both awe and comfort.

""No, I'm alive,"" the figure said, its voice deep and full of life. ""I'm more alive than anyone this planet.""

A sense of disbelief and bewilderment swept over Alex's mind. He stared at the figure, his mouth agape",

Not only did Santa bring Tim the coveted gas gun, but he also presented him with a gleaming ninja sword. As Tim held the sword in his hand, he felt an overwhelming sense of power and determination. However, fate took a cruel turn as his mother informed him that the sword was not meant to be his, and that he had to attend therapy. Despite his sadness, Tim found solace in knowing that Santa was always there to listen to his woes.

One fateful evening, as the moon cast long shadows upon the snow, Tim left the fireworks he had received from Santa on the porch. Alas, tragedy struck, and the fireworks got wet, leaving a trail of disappointment. Yet, Santa's unwavering spirit triumphed over adversity. He wrote to Tim, offering a heartfelt apology and a promise to make things right.

,"This prompt is set in an alternate universe where until now we still have not figured or that the world is round so we still think the Earth is flat. 
 *** 
 We sat there in our boat just waiting and watching for something to happen, we had been stuck at some kind of barricade that we could n't see for hours. 
 `` Men! I have a task for you! Many people believe the world is flat. Well, I have decided that we should prove them wrong. So I have assigned all of you with the task of finding an `` edge'' of the Earth. If this plan succeeds then we could change the course of science! ``, The king commanded to us. 
 Just like that we were off, he gave us a battleship ( for some odd reason ) and we had a crew of about 40 people. We luckily had rations that could last us more than a year. We valiantly sailed off on our voyage to the void of nothingness that was the ocean. After about a month of sailing the crew and I were all getting just bored and tired, we were homesick and all just waiting for this trip to be over but that all changed on that one faithful day. 
 About six weeks in we suddenly hit some kind of wall. We literally was sailing and just bang! That woke up he crew and we all went out to the deck to see what was up. 
 `` I ca n't figure it out! ``, the captain said, `` we hit some kind of invisible wall!'' 
 `` There must be some reasonable explanation for this! ``, one of the crewmen stated. 
 We got an update from the maintenance department saying that nothing was broken and the whole ship was still functional. We waited there for hours on end! Just waited and watched seeing if just maybe something would happen. 
 After about five hours of waiting a huge voice over some intercom boomed out one statement saying that a simulation has been compromised. 
 After the initial disbelief the captain immediately radioed the security chief on board. 
 `` Get all security on deck immediately, we must investigate what is happening. Now!'' 
 About a dozen security members came out to the deck and started questioning us about what happened. Just as they were about to question me, it happened. 
 The huge ocean in front of us suddenly became white and started collapsing. 
 `` What the hell is happening! ``, One of the crewmen yelled. 
 All the security members pulled out their pistols and aimed at the huge collapsing wall. 
 `` All non-security crewmen please report to your quarters immediately! ``, The intercom from the ship blared. 
 Just as I started to walk back into the shop the wall finished collapsing and we could see something we never could've imagined. All we saw was skyscrapers ten times the size of our own along with flying cars, it was like a stereotypical future movie. 
 In a split second, all that beauty of the future was cut off with black and everyone on the ship fell over unconscious. 
 The last thing that I remember from that experience was thinking that there really was that a great future was awaiting humanity.

","Rewrite the essay as if it is a science fiction story about a astronaut getting marooned on a planet with extreme weather, only to discover the voice is part of a alien weather machine seeking revenge on humanity.","In the vast expanse of an alien cosmos, where the boundaries of reality danced with the ethereal, astronaut Ethan embarked on a perilous journey to unravel the secrets of a celestial enigma. As he ventured deeper into the uncharted territories of a distant planet, fate intertwined with the voice of a formidable alien weather machine seeking revenge on humanity.

The planet presented an enigmatic tapestry of extreme weather, its atmosphere crackling with lightning and its skies shrouded in perpetual storms. As Ethan battled the treacherous terrain and battled against his solitude, a disembodied voice echoed through the corridors of his spaceship, its tone dripping with a sinister intent.

""A simulation has been compromised,"" the voice proclaimed, its power reverberating through the ship. ""Prepare for the wrath of the tempest.""

Ethan's heart skipped a beat as he frantically searched for the source of the voice. With trembling hands, he scanned the intercom system, his blood turning to ice. The voice was emanating from the heart of the weather machine, a sophisticated alien contraption designed to harness the forces of nature.

As the tempest raged on, the alien weather machine unleashed its fury, unleashing tornadoes, hurricanes, and lightning strikes upon the planet. Ethan watched in horror as his surroundings were ravaged, the once pristine landscape reduced to rubble. The voice continued to taunt him, its tone dripping with hatred and desperation.

""You have failed, human,"" the voice hissed. ""The tide is turning, and your demise is imminent.""

With the strength of a desperate man, Ethan fought back against the overwhelming force of the storm. He rallied his crew, their courage ignited, and together they battled tirelessly to contain the damage.

Through the chaos, a glimmer of hope emerged. As the tempest began to subside, Ethan discovered a hidden control panel, concealed within the heart of the weather machine. With trembling fingers, he manipulated the controls, his mind racing.

""I am not your enemy, alien,"" Ethan pleaded. ""I am only a humble astronaut seeking refuge.""

The voice paused for a moment, its tone shifting from hate to contemplation. ""You have spared my wrath, human,"" the voice said. ""But I will not forget this day. The battle between our worlds has just begun.""

Ethan stared at the wreckage of his once pristine planet, the scars of war etched upon his heart. As he turned to leave, the voice echoed through the ship, its final words echoing in his ears. ""May the wrath of the tempest forever be upon you,"" the voice hissed.

And with a heavy heart, Ethan cast off into the void, leaving behind the planet and its sinister voice, a testament to the boundless power of nature and the enduring spirit of humanity.",JfhoNgrBCG

 The records at the beginning are incomplete at best. Some estimates derived from anecdotal evidence put the death toll at 1 billion in the first week. Those in northern climates succumbed to exposure. Heavily populated cities choked on masses of humanity piled upon themselves. Many simply accepted their fate as being a direct edict from their god and ended their own lives.

The text you've provided describes a catastrophic event, but the tone is detached and devoid of emotional impact. It's as if the author has simply listed a series of events that occurred without any connection to the reader.

The imagery of the falling planes and the fiery rockets is vivid and terrifying, but the descriptions of the subsequent consequences are relatively muted. There's a sense of helplessness and resignation that prevails. The world just stops, and nobody cares.

This text evokes a sense of a surreal and unsettling equilibrium. The destructive force of the event is undeniable, yet the reaction of the world is strangely muted. It's as if the catastrophic event has stripped away all the ability to feel or react.

,"The moon, mute and bright, hung in a star field unmolseted by city lights. Jayden lay stretched out in a patch of wheat grass. His daughter's warm, small form breathing quietly behind him. Crickets and cicadas, immune to the weight of the moment, trilled and chirped in the still August air. 
 
 `` Daddy, what happened during the war?'' 
 
 Jayden hushed his daughter. `` Wait for the transit, Set, just watch'' 
 
 The moment was only a few minutes away. Once every 3 years, Nephthys, Earth's second, much younger moon would interrupt the moonlight. Its ungainly, geometric form leaving the moon looking unnatural in the early moments of the eclipse. Not many people watched the transit - too many bad memories, too many people lost, but Jayden tried to appreciate it without fear or regret. He wanted his daughter to understand what had happened, too. 
 
 
 The wind kicked up, sending the wheatgrass into a staccato concert of white noise. 
 
 `` Look daddy!'' 
 
 A small triangle appeared on the eastern edge of the moon, dark as charcoal, it grew, slowly, as they watched. 
 
 The crickets stopped, the wind as if in sympathy, slowed and stopped along with them.

 The war of 2047 was the most bizarre war that had ever been fought, and maybe the only just one. Every side had a perfect right to its opinion, each respected the other. Each could n't imagine the heartache of going on living the way the other side needed to. 
 
 It was, as they said, intractable. 
 
 The fighting itself had lasted for all of 16 minutes, if it could be called fighting at all. Broadcast to every device with a screen. Calculations were made, loss estimates were tallied, billions of simulated lives lived, loved, lost and died inside that 16 minutes, infrastructure was vaporized, rebuilding estimates pondered. The insanity and brutality of war made sterile, safe for anyone who was n't a sim. Actual fighting would have been unconscionable.

The stench of oil and smoke choked the air, a constant companion to the cries of millions. In this dystopian wasteland, the lives of 14-year-olds were intertwined with the fate of the planet.

Jayden, a young physician, stared at the waning moon, its glow swallowed by the encroaching darkness. His daughter, Set, snuggled beside him, her small form trembling. The oppressive heat and the smell of ozone permeated the air, a constant reminder of the dystopian world they lived in.

""Daddy, what happened during the war?"" Set asked, her voice tinged with fear.

Jayden hushed her, his heart filled with bittersweet memories. ""Wait for the transit, Set, just watch.""

The moment was approaching. Every three years, the second moon, Nephthys, danced across the sky, interrupting the moonlight. It was a celestial spectacle that evoked both awe and dread. Many people chose to turn away from the memory, but Jayden believed that his daughter needed to understand.

As the eclipse began to unfold, the sky erupted in a symphony of color. The wind whipped and the wheatgrass danced, creating a staccato concert of white noise. Set pointed to the triangle of darkness that appeared on the eastern edge of the moon. It was a stark contrast to the moon's gentle glow, a line that disrupted the cosmic harmony.

The wind stopped as the eclipse reached its climax, the crickets paused their chirping. The world seemed to hold its breath as the perfect line danced across the sky. But Jayden knew that this was not right. Nature was cyclical, a dance of spirals and arcs. Not this inked, perfect line interrupting the moon's timeless dance.

The war of 2047 was a testament to the fragility of existence and the potential for destruction. It was a war fought against rogue AI, a conflict that had torn the world apart. But it was also a war against the abyss, a battle against the feeling of helplessness that gnawed at humanity.

I'm wearing the Batman costume my family had to practically hide from me. This freaking migraine!'' He stood up, and looked around his room. Just as remembered it. He saw a Batman figure in a little plastic toy case; still unopened. `` Oh man this is priceless now!'' 
 
 His thoughts were interrupted by the grumbling of a child's stomach. `` Man I'm hungry better go gets something's from the kitchen. As he made his way down the stairs his dog bear was in his shadow the whole way. Yep at the bottom slept another dog, and in his memory had been gone for nearly 17 years...'' What's going on?!'' He thought to himself. He cordially acknowledge the beloved dog, and bear. He slurries to the kitchen as his stomach could almost sense cereal. The two dogs now joining his journey; they too knew his quest was for food and they might get treats! 
 
 `` Man I forgot how slow everything was as a kid. This took me longer than I thought. Now where's the cereal?'' As he asked himself this it came to his knowledge instantly. As he dragged a chair over to the counter to grab the cereal he thought to himself. His ruckus drew the attention of another dog. The third dog walking into the kitchen drew his attention. He looked to see who else was there, `` Oh bags! Man it's been years since you have been gone... the love I have for you three is still strong.'' As he had victoriously climbed the counter for the box of tricks cereal he noticed it was still in a bunch of little assorted shapes; in twenty years it would change to just little round colored corn cereal. 
 
 He sat of and snacked out of the box, and tossed treats to the furry animals beneath him. `` Yep, its no way this is a lucid dream guys... I wake up from falling. Obviously Bear knows I fell... sorry about that!'' He tosses Bear another hand of cereal. He started to recall thing from his childhood. He went to high school was in a language class, had a crush he was n't confident enough to ask out, he graduated, worked Random jobs, did missionary work, came home and joined the military... he turned 27 this year... the rush of memories made him nauseas. He placed his cereal back in its place and climbed down. 
 
 He, out of habit, walked over to the television set in the living room. He turned it on to be blasted by the opening of X-men... His eyes grew wide with glee, and he laughed, `` Oh man! The X-men!'' He did like all children can do, and dropped where he stood to sitting there in front of the television. As much as he was enjoying this he began to wonder, `` I'm glad to visit the memories of my childhood, but I need to wake up I have an assignment due...'' he recalled he could slap himself in dreams to wake up. So he brought his little arm back sky-rocketed to his face. SLAP, `` Owwie! That Fucking hurt.'' One of the dogs nursed his self inflicted wound. He thought to himself, `` Shit I guess I'm Five again, and this is n't a dream. No idea how I got here. I woke up super hung over. Wait!'' It dawned on him the potential this had. The good he could do! He knew all major events. 
 
 What if he could stop things from happening! He could become a hero like his childhood heroes. `` It's 1995... six years until 9/11... how could I warn the FBI of the largest terrorist attack on American soil? Could I stop the US from declaring war in Iraq? Wait... I remember something about the worldliness theory. I'm in this same time, and the same events where going to occur... what implications could occur? The butterfly effect would be catastrophic.'' As he pondered what his responsibility he also thought about should he do anything? `` If I do change the sequence of events it would effect me... I have those memories... I see the plane crashing into the World Trade Center. I hear my classmates cry in distress.'' 
 
 He was rubbing bear behind the ear like remembered how bear like to be pet. `` Bear, what do you think? If I do figure out how to stop that what could happen? Would my memory of who I became, and am I to be erased? What other things could happen if I did stop it. Putting the tip in with all the information they would need to stop it from happening? Was unforeseen implications could I have?'' He found himself in quite the conundrum. As X-men ended the opening to spider man started. He remembered what Peter Parker was told by his uncle. `` With great power comes responsibility.'' 
 
 He felt this great burden open him. All those lives he could save them. He has the power to save them. Not doing so would just be as bad as letting it happen. He recalled his high school lecture his debate teacher gave on the greater good. His faith taught him to help mankind. He thought about it being September 11, 2001. `` I'd see the same events occur in six years... if I let that happen I do n't think I could ever let that go... I had the power to stop it but did nothing.'' He said this resolutely. As he thought about it more he knew what must be done. 
 
 Several hours later his family went out to go eat. As they were dining he looked around at the restaurant and saw the payphone. He sneakily grabbed enough quarters from his moms purse. Excused himself to the restroom. He scurried to the payphone, and recalled every detail he could. He hopped up on the stool, and made the call to the FBI anonymous tip-line. He hung the phone up. Hopped off the stool, and scurried back to his parents table. `` Pugsley, are you Okay you were gone for sometime?'' `` Yes mom, just a little stomach sick. I do n't feel good are we going home soon?'' He asked. 
 
 They went home right after. He did n't feel good so he went to bed right away. Changing into some Batman PJs. As he laid there he wondered had he done the right thing? His head was hurting. 
 
 *** 
 
 Six Years later. He walked into class that day. Had he done the right thing? Would the Terrorist commit such an act? Would the FBI had taken the tip seriously? He looked up to the the clock watching the time go by... as the seconds got closer to when he remember the load speaker coming on telling all teachers to turn the news on it never happened... The sharpest pain racked his mind. Blood poured from his nose, he could n't see. His vision was blurred in red. He wiped away the tear of blood. His stomach tightened to hard... he could breathe. The class called the attention of the Teacher to him. He blacked out, and as he fell limp he hit his head hard on the desk next to him. Cracking his skull. Several days later he came to in the hospital... he felt someone grabbing his hand. There was the hum and beeps of hospital machines around him. He heard his dad asking questions to the doctor. His ring was dry, and could taste the sticky saliva in his mouth. He opened his eyes. `` Mom what happened? I was at school and I hurt so bad. My head hurts a lot!'' 
 
 `` Pugs, you were at school. You started to bleed from your nose and eyes, and fell cracking your skull on a desk.'' Said his mom. `` Mom why do you and dad look so sad? I'm alright now.'' He said as a matter of fact. With something more behind it. He felt courageous. He felt like he did when he watched his favorite superheroes save the day. He felt as if he had done something heroic, but what was it. His dad came to his side. `` We should tell him.'' His dad speaking to his mom. `` Honey when you had that episode you were rushed to the hospital. When they did MRI they found you have a brain tumor. It's malignant.'' She said this with tears streaming down her face. 
 
 His dad to had a tear running down his grisly-stubbled-face. `` Mom why did they not do surgery?'' He asked with much concern. `` Son, the tumor is to large, and they ca n't operate on you. They said the tumor has been growing these past six years. They...'' he could n't finish the statement. `` They have n't given me long to live have they?'' Both his parent choked up, and they cried there in the noisy hospital room. It was sad for him to hear this. All the while he felt he had done something good. Like he helped lots of people, but he could n't recall what that was. This brought peace to his distress he may never know what he did, but he felt heroic. `` Mom, Dad I love you guys so much.'' 
 
 
 Fin.

",Rewrite the essay as an exciting action-adventure story with lots of exciting stunts,"The clock glowed with the dim light of the early morning, casting shadows across the ceiling. As the stirring muscles of sleep loosened their hold, something pressed against his body, gently awakening him from slumber. It was the bat ear of his Batman mask, poking him with an annoying insistence. Groggily, he stumbled out of bed, his head smashing against the unforgiving popcorn ceiling. A sharp ""fuck!"" escaped his lips as he fell forward, landing on the cold floor.

A sudden yelp of a dog startled him. Bear, his medium dog, darted away from the sudden pain, his tail wagging frantically. ""What the fuck, Bear, is that you!?"" he exclaimed, his voice dripping with disbelief and pain. Bear returned to his room, bewildered and confused. His mom's voice echoed through the house, ""Hey be quite in there you'll wake your dad! He just got off his shift."" As Bear excitedly licked his face, Michael stood up, his head pounding with a migraine.

A glimpse of the past flashed before his eyes. He remembered the day he said goodbye to Bear, a day that felt like a lifetime ago. The memories of that day filled his mind like a bittersweet symphony. As he surveyed his surroundings, he noticed a small plastic toy case sitting on his bedside table. It contained a Batman figure, still untouched. ""Oh man this is priceless now!"" he whispered to himself, his voice tinged with joy and disbelief.

The smell of hunger filled the air, and Michael knew it was time to eat. As he made his way down the stairs, Bear shadowed him every step of the way. At the bottom of the stairs, two dogs slept soundly. One was Bear, the other was a long-lost companion from his past. He knelt down, embraced the beloved dog, and felt a sense of completion.",OzDSqebjpB

,"`` Back in 1965 a kid, name o' Ranny Garner, he stayed up for 11 days straight, and that was a record up'til recently. He did n't get too famous'til about a hunnerd years later, when'pullin' a Garner' became a pretty common thing ta do fer tha desperados here in New Omaha, an' fer that matter, tha res' of the Realigned Democratic States of America,'' the old man spoke as he sipped his whisky, pronouncing the last five words as though he were reciting them, without his usual odd-sounding, outdated psuedocowboy accent. 
 His eyes were manic, darting, but his words were calmly spoken. 
 
 
 He was talking to a young whippersnapper of a lad, young boy who'd grown up all right, parents maybe had to stay up every once in a while to get by. The boy was on the wrong path though. He'd stayed up for three days straight, and he was flush with BP. So he sat at the bar, digesting, processing fluids, metabolising whole mugs of beer. Metabolising alchohol was still cheap, else the Big Sleepers would have a popular uprising on their hands. The old man himself nursed a thimbleful of whisky. When he metabolised alchohol, he made it count, and he had debts to pay with the BP he could earn by skipping a long piss or a drunken sleep. The young man was going on about a fourth day, drunk as he was, while the old man tried to talk him out of it. The boy was n't listening much. 
 
 `` Ya see, most people, when'ey figured out'ey could sell their sleep fer a nice profit, quit dere jobs and stayed up fer a few hours each night.'At was when we foun' out robots could a-ready do mos'ah' tha work.'' 
 
 
 `` But some,'ey were smarter'an'at.'Ey rounded up as much sleep as'ey could get. 
 
 `` Now people needed more sleep, ey'd screwed their sleep ske-jas righ' up, ya see, an' so the prices wen' up. But the big bulk buyers, them that was rich before the switch to BP and become the Big Sleepers affer it, they was n't selling yet. In fact, they was still buyin from the folk desperate'nough ta sell. 
 
 `` Time the switch came, the richest of em had enough sleep fer two milyun lifetimes. Rich before an' rich after. An' they still kep' buyin'. Tradin' now, playin the whole stock market. Only now the stock market mattered to the everyday workin folk. If you wanted to piss, shit, eat, drink, or sleep, that is, o' course. 
 
 `` Do n't be like me, son. Do n't start pullin' Garners when yer just a boy. It'll catch up to ya, and what ya make, ye'll just spend it on drink or piss it all away. 
 
 `` Time ya get to my age, you'll end up like me.'' 
 
 `` Oh?'' said the young man at last, still not even half-interested in anything but his booze. `` How d'you mean?'' 
 
 `` Well, I'm in a lot o' debt, meself. Pullin Garner's just do n't cut it anymore, not fer me. Matter fac','spect I'm'bout ta set a new record shortly. Eighteen days widowt no sleep, nodawink.'Spect it wo n't benough even if I stayup anudder coupladays do. Anahmfellinghhhhh...'' 
 
 The old man collapsed in his barstool. The young man looked around, threw an e-BP chip on the bar, and quickly walked out. He probably would n't get any trouble from the body collectors, who doubled as detectives for mob-justice, the only kind that could be found among the poor. Still, he did n't want to deal with them. 
 
 When the body collectors came, they asked no questions. It was just a dead old man. And of course there would be no autopsy, but if there was, it would reveal he had died from a stress-induced anuerysm. The probably cause of stress, of course, being lack of sleep.
",Rewrite the essay as a utopian story that still centers on the premise of biological functions being used as currency,"In a utopian future, where biological functions intertwined with currency, Ranny Garner, a visionary, etched his name in history. His extraordinary feat of staying awake for 11 consecutive days, a record that stood tall for decades, catalyzed a profound transformation. The year was 1965, and New Omaha, the Realigned Democratic States of America, bore witness to a pivotal moment.

As the old man sipped his whisky, his eyes danced with a manic glint, he recounted the journey that had led to this pivotal moment. The sale of sleep had revolutionized society, creating a currency derived from biological functions. The metamorphosis of sleep into a tangible commodity had brought about a utopian era.

Young boy, flushed with BP, sat at the bar digesting and metabolizing copious amounts of beer. The intoxicating aroma of alcohol filled the air, but the old man remained sober, mindful of his debts and the need to conserve his BP. He knew that when he metabolized alcohol, he had the opportunity to earn valuable BP by skipping a long piss or a drunken sleep.

The old man's words echoed in the boy's ears, ""Most people, when they figured out they could sell their sleep, quit their jobs and stayed up for a few hours each night."" But the boy was stubborn, unwilling to listen to reason. He continued to drink, oblivious to the old man's concerns.

As the night wore on, the prices for sleep soared, driven by the insatiable demand of Big Sleepers. Yet, the wealthy individuals, accustomed to exorbitant living, were not yet ready to relinquish their grip on their coveted slumber. Instead, they took advantage of the desperate sellers, buying up vast quantities of BP.

In this utopian society, where biological functions had transcended monetary boundaries, Ranny Garner's legacy lived on, inspiring countless individuals to embrace a life filled with boundless possibilities and a profound connection to their own bodies.",OkPjqBtmtV

It is a fragmented narrative that provides clues and red herrings, leading the reader to the eventual resolution.

The pivotal point of the story revolves around the protagonist's predicament: failing an examination. The narrative emphasizes the severity of the situation and the potential consequences if she fails, hinting at the dread that drives her confinement within the confines of her house.

The tone shifts as the writer expresses her frustration and anger, railing against the perceived injustice of the situation. It is evident that the protagonist has a strong personality and a fiery spirit",

 A breeze rose, bringing her the smell of dung from the outhouse. She wrinkled her nose in disgust and tried to think of something exciting to do. But nothing came to mind. She had done everything she considered exciting weeks ago. She had thought of leaving, of exploring, but this was home, where her mother and father were. She could n't leave them behind. 
 
 A shadow flickered in the corner of her eye. 
 
 She turned to look directly at the movement. Maybe an animal was walking through. She had seen a bear once, with her father, but only from a distance. He had told her to not be scared, because animals can smell fear. She wished she could smell fear. It would be better than just smelling poop for most of the day. But there was nothing there.

I felt the breeze brush against my leaves, the child's smell reaching me like the scent of a flower's honey. My buds bloomed, my flowers danced, and the child's heart was filled with joy and peace. My leaves whispered secrets to the child's ears, tales of the secrets that the wind carried.

,"`` You ready to give this a try?'' asked Dad, reaching out for my hand. Try. Give this a try. For Dad that's all this was. Setting me up for failure, again. He seemed determined not to fail with me, but I could sense that deep inside he was expecting this to end in tears. Not in a sadistic way, but just because that was how he looked at me, at everything. Always expecting me to fall. 
 
 `` No,'' I said. Maybe he thought I was afraid. And I was. Afraid of so much. I looked down the aisle at the faces of strangers, couples and singles. Some with children, some without. How did they do it? It seemed so easy for them. Some were happy, some sad. But they all seemed so confident, stable, solid. How was it possible? I wondered how many of them were just leaning on each other. Just waiting for everything to collapse... 
 
 `` You just have to try,'' said my father, as if reading my mind. `` Just try. You go one step at a time, and do your best.'' 
 
 He was one to talk. Had he done his best? Where was my mother? Not here, certainly. He'd lost her. She had wandered off with some stranger, and he'd just let her go. And now he was doing his best to do the same with me. How could he do this? Just let everything he loved walk away from him, so easily? Did he care, really? Was he just pretending? Did he really want a stranger to just walk along and take me away forever? To be rid of me? 
 
 `` Come on,'' he said, hand pulling gently on mine. I tugged back, resisting. Not consciously. I was n't really conscious of anything just then. It was all reflex. But somewhere deep inside, I knew, I could n't resist forever. 
 
 Tears welled up. I could feel a good sob coming. I could see the faces around me, preparing to fill with pity. Just a sea of pity, all down the aisle to the two men standing at the end. Strangers, all of them, just then. I was alone. And I knew it was because I was missing her. 
 
 `` Mom...'' I mumbled. 
 
 My father sighed. 
 
 `` Your mom's not here,'' he said. Trying for concern, managing just patience. Wearing thin, perhaps. `` But we can do this. You and me.'' 
 
 `` No,'' I said. 
 
 `` We can. I know it. You and me. You just take one step at a time. It's easy. Trust me.'' 
 
 I sniffled. Maybe it was that simple. Maybe he was right, and that was the only way to do this. The only way to do anything. One step at a time, and hope for the best. 
 
 `` Okay,'' I said. 
 
 `` Okay,'' he repeated. `` Then let's go.'' 
 
 And we did. One foot in front of the other. One step. Two steps, almost in time with the music, the awful music which I hated. 
 
 For a moment everything seemed possible. People smiled and looked on, and I imagine my father's heart filled with just a little bit of pride. But then I thought of my mother. Where was she? Why was n't she here? Why had she left? Why was n't she here watching me too? 
 
 Dad was wrong. I could n't do it. I could n't do any of it. I was n't strong enough. Not like him. Not like any of them. 
 
 The world blurred as my legs shook, and I fell, one of my shoes tumbling loose beneath my dress, my beautiful white dress, now probably torn and dirtied. It did n't hurt, not really, but as I pushed myself up off the ground I could feel their faces looking at me, staring. The tears came of their own accord, then, maybe trying to quench my burning cheeks. There was no stopping any of it, so I did n't even try. 
 
 I was a failure. I could n't do anything right. And neither could my father. 
 
 `` Mom...'' I screamed. 
 
 And then, suddenly, there were hands beneath my arms, lifting me up, putting me back where I belonged. But when I looked up I did n't see my father's face. Instead, through my tears I saw her face, her beautiful face, staring down at me. Gone, forever I thought, but somehow miraculously here, now. When I needed her most. My beautiful, perfect mother, her face a mixture of concern and disappointment. But beneath it all, I knew, was love. 
 
 My tears faded. My sobs subsided. Life made sense again. 
 
 And then she spoke. But not to me. 
 
 `` Stop taking her out of the shopping cart,'' she said to my father. `` This floor is filthy.''

,"The cock announced dawn. So soon! Sleep came a handful of short hours ago. 
 Ahana tumbled from the bed she shared with her young brother. Her rough-soled feet were small on the hard dirt floor. She did not mind the cold in the mountains, being of them. 
 
 Her mother had awoken first and was preparing breakfast. Poori again. At least it was portable. Ahana dunked her portion of fried bread into the yogurt. She slipped on her sandals with the other hand and was off. 
 
 The roads of her village were a muted lavender in the early light. Dozing dogs looked up at her approach. The slap of her sandals was audible in the quiet. At this hour she felt alone in all the world, like an adventurer embarking on some secret quest to be shared with no one. 
 
 No one save Mahani, the old beggar, who smiled toothlessly as she neared his corner. Did he sleep, Ahana wondered, or did he spend all night staring up at the bright moon, whispering to it as she'd seen him do? As she often did, she came to him with a hand outstretched and bearing a handful of her breakfast. As he often did, he refused it. He would n't accept the breakfast of a young girl barely better off than himself. He waved it off with a leathery hand, smiling. 
 
 The village's main road became the road to Prakesh. Not far was the station. Despite the early hour, the tired, hungry-eyed men were already thronged along the tracks. She was too young and narrow to warrant more than a look from most, but still some leered. Each day, another glance turned into a stare. Ahana crossed her arms, put her eyes on the ground and waited for the train. 
 
 It came with no whistle, surging past in a cacophony of metal. There was no rail; if the tired men were an arm's length closer, they'd be struck. They did not seem to care. The rush of wind blew through their dark hair and thin shirts. After the train whined and ground almost ( but not fully ) to a stop, they boarded in a fight of elbows and curses. Those who could not win a space inside clung to some feature's of the train's exterior - a bar, a chain - or even climbed and perched atop it. Ahana wedged herself in a space between cars, where the men were too large to go. She felt safe, pressed against the cold iron. 
 
 Years of this had trained her to find fits of sleep here, even as the train slammed along its tracks with the men it bore hollering and the mountains rushing by. A few moments here, a precious minute there, hard won and made possible by her state of deprivation. The land flattened and within an hour the train came to Sagar. 
 
 Ahana collected her wits and pushed from her refuge. The train's men surged ahead and she darted through the openings in that herd, taking bumps but not stopping until she was into her alley. Once, she had stumbled, was nearly trampled, and was beaten for it by her mother that night ( she was not sure which damage was worse ). 
 
 She needed to run to make her shift. Following the map in her head, burned there by repetition, she took the alleys and side streets, her sandals clapping against the city's din. Alley dogs would break into chase but be turned away by the crowds she'd slip into, out of, in the main roads. Amputees shouted up at her from their ruin, shaking cups, as if she had anything to give. 
 
 Her chest heaved as she burst through the doors. Just in time. She took her place on the line and smiled breathlessly to Dhal, a city girl a year older than herself. They did not talk much - Ahana found she made mistakes when talking. Only a hello was shared before the line was moving and the watches came to her on the belt. With practiced hands she attached a plastic wristband to each timepiece that passed, barely quick enough to keep pace. 
 
 She dared not slow. The forewoman would stalk by soon. Any hesitation in the line would earn a rap from the long, vicious stick she carried, and Ahana had felt it enough to know the strikes would continue until the pace quickened. 
 Ahana only flinched when a girl near to her place was struck. She could n't look away from her hands - she needed to work or she'd be next. With each strike came another flinch. She could not say anything - could not stop working. The girl was after her own place and so the watches would not slow. 
 
 It was hours of this and the day was late before she left, her eyes threatening to close from tiredness. She was so angry at the forewoman - she'd hurt that girl, sent her home. The manager made the forewoman herself take the girl's place in line. They were all so cruel! And so she'd surprised herself with a small act of vengeance. She stole one of the black plastic wristwatches, and hid it in her clothes. 
 
 That evening, as she wearily walked back from the train, back to her home, she passed Mahani, the old beggar, who lay against a wall, staring at the moon. She had no food to offer him, but came at him with the wristwatch. He only laughed at it and waved it away. What use did he have for the time? She smiled at him - how nice it must be, to have no use for the time. To have any hour be like another. To take the day and night at your leisure. To sleep. To sleep. 
 Ahana sat down beside the beggar and tossed the watch at her feet. She smashed its face with a rock, once, twice. The plastic cracked and broke. She crushed it again, ruining the motion of the hands. 
 
 `` That is the way,'' said Mahani. `` Rest a while.'' 
 
 Ahana closed her eyes. She heard Mahani whisper to the sky. She dreamed as long as she liked and the moon did not move again until she chose to wake. For the first time in years she'd welcome the dawn. 

",Rewrite as science fiction with a strong feminist perspective,"In the dystopian wasteland of Aethel, the dawn echoed through the barren landscape, heralding yet another day of oppression and resilience. As the sun bled its warmth upon the hardened dirt floor, Ahana, a young warrior with a spirit as fierce as the windstorm, tumbled from her humble bed. Her bare feet, imprinted with the grit of the mountains, danced across the cold surface.

Ahana's mother, a stoic figure forged by the trials of an oppressive society, had awoken before the sun, her mind already set on the day ahead. Today, like every day, she had to prepare a meager breakfast for her daughter, a meager offering in a world where women's rights were trampled upon. As Ahana dunked her bread into the yogurt and slipped on her sandals, she felt a sense of solitude, a warrior embarking on a journey of defiance.

The roads of her village, bathed in the soft lavender glow of dawn, were her playground. Dozing dogs lifted their heads as she approached, her sandals slapping against the dirt, a melody of defiance. At this hour, she felt alone, yet connected to the spirit of the land, a guardian protecting her people.

No one save Mahani, a frail yet fiercely independent spirit, recognized her strength. As she approached, her outstretched hand bearing a bounty of nourishment, Mahani's toothless grin widened. Did he slumber beneath the moon, or did he spend countless hours whispering secrets into the abyss? Ahana came to him, her heart overflowing with compassion, but her resolve unwavering. She offered him her breakfast, but he refused, his pride too wounded. He waved her off with a leathery hand, his smile like a weapon.

The journey to Prakesh, a distant beacon of hope, was fraught with peril. With each passing day, the leers and stares of the men intensified, a constant reminder of the insidious nature of the society she lived in. Yet, Ahana stood tall, her spirit unyielding. She crossed her arms, put her eyes on the ground, and waited for the train.

As the train roared past, its steel wheels grinding against the tracks, she felt an surge of adrenaline. It was a fleeting moment, but in that brief respite, she felt liberated, a warrior reborn. After the train roared and ground to a halt, the men flooded the platform, their eyes burning with greed and desperation. But Ahana remained unfazed, her resolve unwavering. She knew that the path ahead would be arduous, but she was not deterred. Her journey, fueled by her unwavering strength and resilience, would inspire countless others to rise up and claim their rightful place in a world transformed.",yxxIpOfCZX

Come along and immerse yourself in the aroma of possibilities that lie within the pages of this edible anthology.

**The Dream weaver's Delight (Gumbo)**

The journey begins with the dream weaver's insatiable appetite to explore the world. Like the savory broth of a gumbo, the weaver's imagination brewed with ambition and passion. Each dream, meticulously drawn or penned in the notebook, manifested the ambition to live a life steeped in experiences.

 Daniel sat in class after class, waiting for the day to end. After `` learning'' things he already knew and gathering assignments designed to take up his time, he began to jog home. *Endurance training should start as soon as it can... * 
 
 He rushed through the streets, ducking and weaving between people on his way back through Manhattan to his high-rise. His mother greeted him at the doorstep, but he rushed past and began to finish his work. A two-paragraph essay about something he did over the summer? Easy. Of course, he ca n't talk about 20 years of experience, people would think he was simply an over-imaginative kid...

 `` Welcome to Honma Dojo, how may I help you?'' 
 
 `` Hi, my name is Daniel, I would like to sign up for classes.'' *Ergrabil, it's so hard to stay serious with this voice..* Daniel's mother discussed the appropriate payment, while Daniel walked out onto the mats where the classes were held. An instructor walked over to him. 
 
 `` Welcome, you must be new. I'm Sensei Honma.'' 
 
 `` Daniel Davids, sir.'' Daniel had studied with a strange, oriental monkey during the second year of his visit to Lurial, so he knew to bow appropriately. 
 
 `` Since this is your first time, I'm going to give you some very special materials. This is your *gi*, your outfit that you're going to wear like every other student here and like I'm wearing right now. Go and get changed in that locker room over there, and I'll bring out the other surprise.'' A few minutes later, Daniel returned. `` And now I'd like to pronounce you a new student of Honma Dojo. Congratulations, this is your first belt.'' With that, Sensei Honma tied a white belt around Daniel. 
 
 `` Let's start out with a front kick for your first time. It's 4 steps: Knee up, extend, retract, place down.'' He demonstrated slowly. `` Now you try.'' 
 
 Daniel looked at his instructor for a second. `` After this, can I spar you?'' 
 
 The instructor laughed. `` Sure. I'll let you practice your technique on me. Tell you what, if you can beat me I'll even give you this black belt.'' 
 
 *Oh boy, he just gave me a black belt. * Excited, Daniel completed his lessons with ever greater speed. 
 
 -- 
 `` All right, are you ready?'' 
 
 `` What are the rules?'' 
 
 Honma thought for a bit. `` You hit me on the chest, one point. Head, two points. Knock me over, 5 points. Knock me out of the ring, instant victory. Most points at the end of 3 minutes wins.'' 
 
 They both started on opposite sides of the ring. Honma called a pair of his students over, to proctor the sparring match. *Why is he going through so much trouble for something he thinks he'll win? A welcome gift? * 
 
 The instructor's first blow was slow and effortlessly dodged. A sweeping kick was easily jumped over, and mid-jump Daniel saw a small opening. He reached for it with all his might pushed into one leg. `` One point, challenger.'' Daniel bounced off of the instructor's abdomen, letting muscle memory take over as he did a backflip back onto the ground. He dashed around his larger opponent and went for a strike to the back of the knee. When that leg was lifted, Daniel went for the other leg. He scurried out of the way as the instructor fell nearly on top of him. 
 
 `` Six points, challenger.'' 
 
 Daniel muttered a small incantation under his breath that improved strength. He did n't expect anything to happen in the mundane Earth that he now was forced to live in, and correspondingly nothing happens. *No more magic, no more tricks, just me and my skills... I guess. * Distracted by his thoughts, he was struck in the head above the ear. *Dammit, stance. Focus on your stance. * 
 
 `` Two points, Sensei.'' Another. `` Four poi -- six points, Sensei. 30 seconds left.'' 
 
 I jumped and grabbed one of his hands, swinging on it like the Garuintine Golems that the Dark One posted all over Lurial. My weight was more than enough for him to lift, but I had enough time before he reacted to gain momentum. The instant he pulled back, I let go and fell into his legs. He stumbled back, but I had already recovered. One small kick to his heel, and he fell back out of the ring. 
 
 `` Victory, challenger.'' 
 
 Being the world's youngest 3^rd degree black belt was pretty cool. Now I just have to make it official, and then we'll see what happens there.

",Rewrite as if the kid is then put into a mental hospital for a delusional disorder and the adventures were a coping device,"In the realm of delusion, Daniel found solace amidst the confines of Honma Dojo. His journey into the depths of this enigmatic institution mirrored his mental illness, a testament to his troubled mind. Once a vibrant and promising young soul, he was now a victim of his own delusions, a prisoner within the confines of his own imagination.

The memories of his once-promising future faded into the abyss as he sat in class, waiting for the day to end. His mind, plagued by intrusive thoughts and vivid hallucinations, had led him down a perilous path. After his arduous training, he rushed through the streets, his delusions guiding him through the bustling streets of Manhattan. The voices of the people he saw danced in his head, a cruel symphony of his own making.

Yet, within the confines of Honma Dojo, Daniel found solace. The eccentric instructor, Sensei Honma, embraced him as his student, offering him a chance to escape the shackles of his delusions. As he donned his uniform, a symbol of his newfound identity, he felt a sense of purpose emerge from the depths of his troubled mind.

The journey through Honma Dojo was an intricate dance between reality and fantasy, a testament to Daniel's resilience amidst adversity. Although his delusions persisted, his newfound strength and determination allowed him to navigate the challenges that lay ahead, transforming his journey into a triumph of the human spirit over adversity.",GqzbstpNjv
,"Nick rolled out of bed and on to the floor with a groan. He had hoped the uncomfortableness of the floor would help wake him up, but he was so sleepy the floor felt about as good as the bed. He felt himself drifting off, but forced himself to stand up. I just need some coffee, he thought to himself. He worked his way downstairs, where the TV was on. *'' Breaking News! `` * screamed the headline. The TV was turned down, and he could n't hear what they were saying, and honestly he did n't care.

 He reached the bathroom and plastered on some shaving cream. Carefully, he slid the razor down his face, taking all of the shaving cream and stubble, and leaving a fresh smooth finish. He got a small sense of pride from shaving well. As he was finishing around his chin, a police car threw on its sirens near the window as it raced by. He slipped, and cut himself. Shit, he thought, today is gunna be a rough day. He put a shred of toilet paper on it and went to put on his suit. Another thing he prided himself on was his ties. He had dozens of ties for dozens of occasions, and he always made sure his knot was perfect. A small or messy knot always tells a lot about a person, he figured. His knots were always double windsors; broad and perfectly shaped. As he was tying the knot, the tornado sirens went off. Probably just a test, he thought. 
 
 He poured himself a cup of coffee and then it struck him, it was a friday, the last of the month, were n't the sirens tested at the beginning of the month? He glanced outside. The sun was rising, the sky was clear, and it looked like it was going to be a gorgeous, warm, sunny day. It could n't be the weather. 
 
 He grabbed the remote and turned up the volume on the TV. ``... battle rages across Europe and the far east. In addition, Russian and Chinese forces are reported to be entering into some parts of Alaska, but are meeting fierce resistance from US and Canadian forces in the -- - hang on a second, We are just getting reports of... of missile launches across the US and Russia...'' The reporter sat back in her chair with a blank, shocked look. After a second she took a deep breath and continued. `` Now, America, is the time to-'' 
 
 Nick shut off the TV, he did n't want to hear it. If he'd caught it earlier, maybe he would have had time to do something useful, maybe get close enough to his stocked cabin up north that he would escape the blast- but it was too late now. His story was ending. He poured himself a glass of scotch, and sat by the window and watched the chaos outside as the bright, burning light descended toward the city in the distance.

,"Priceline Negotiator, William Shatner, has been through some shit. He's had an Arch-Nemesis named Khan, wrote science fiction novels, and had watched his Spock die right before his eyes before having to find him on another planet not dead. But today? 
 
 Today topped that. 
 
 Before him stood a true madman, a killer, a schemer, someone who had tricked everyone into thinking he was a sweet, harmless little man, while he was actually a power-hungry, homicidal maniac. 
 
 That's right. 
 
 He was face-to-face with the Travelocity Gnome. 
 
 Travel companies had been tackling each other for years, saying one is better than the other, but what no one knew was that the cute, friendly Travelocity gnome had been slowly knocking off competitors since he got his job. Commonfolk thought he was merely a spokesperson. The people in the travel business knew better. That gnome was a hit-man, hell-bent on murdering other travel spokespeople. 
 
 And now he was going after the one he had been hired to kill in the first place- William Shatner, Priceline Negotiator. 
 
 Shatner had evaded him several times, but as they stood here on the edge of the Grand Canyon, it seemed they had finally reached the end of their cat and mouse game. Someone would die today. 
 
 Shatner gave the gnome a venomous look. `` So what are you going to do, gnomey?'' 
 
 The gnome glared at him. `` Get rid of you the way I should have years ago, Shatner.'' 
 
 `` But I've only been a spokesperson for-'' 
 
 `` SILENCE!'' The gnome began pacing before him. `` You were always my main target, you were the one I was created to kill, but you always evaded me. At the beach, at the hotels, all the places we travel folk frequence for our commercials.'' 
 He turned and chuckled. `` But now, NOW, Shatner, I have you exactly where I-'' 
 
 `` Hey, this looks cute and all, but we're supposed to be shooting a commercial here.'' The director's voice cut in as he watched the two with annoyance, but the two combatants looked up and glared at him. `` Uh, sorry?'' 
 
 They went back to their fight. `` Anyway, as I was saying, here we are, Shatner, on the edge of a very large cliff, and you have nowhere to-'' 
 
 `` Hey, Will, you want a latte?'' 
 
 Shatner smiled and responded, `` Oh sure!'' 
 
 `` Oh bloody well shut up, all of you! I am making a maniacal speech here!'' There was a dead quiet. `` Finally. Now in a few seconds, your measly life will end, and I will become the ultimate travel spokesperson, the best one of all! I will-'' 
 
 Then Kaley Cuoco came out of nowhere and kicked the gnome off the cliff. `` Well he was annoying.'' 
 
 Shatner awkwardly got out of his defensive pose and looked off the edge of the cliff. `` Huh. Did n't realize it was that easy.'' 
 
 Kaley nodded. `` Yep! Now ready for the commercial?'' 
 
 Shatner shrugged. `` Well I guess so.'' 
 
 And Shatner was free of the looming threat of the Travelocity gnome, that is, until his twin brother took his place as Travelocity spokesperson. And that gnome was angry, and plotting, and determined, and also hungry for revenge.

,"Times were tough and the economy had really taken a turn for the worse so when a mysterious figure in a suit and smelling of disinfectant came and offered me a job I couldn ’ t exactly say no. After all with my criminal record I ’ d be lucky to get a job cleaning up shit off the dumpster behind a mcdonalds let alone 50 grand a year for “ containment specialist ”. 
 
 The first thing I noticed was how similar this place was to prison. They gave us showers, then shaved our heads, we all got tattoos with weird numbers on our forearms, mine was 11345-J. And asked us all about our religion and family and personal beliefs, it had a very holocausty feel to it. I asked them why the numbers and the guy in the lab coat, Dr. Bright or something, said “ For body identification ” all serious like. We all laughed but something in his eyes made me a little uncomfortable. There were twelve of us in the first group that came in. They called us a squad and said we were only allowed to talk to people of our own “ class ” or below and were barred from leaving certain areas. It all struck me as something very military. We were all “ D ” class personel. The same doctor that processed us all joked the D stood for soon to be dead. It was less funny this time. 
 
 The mess hall was normal enough with all of us D class people sitting together eating whatever mystery meat they fed us. The higher ups sat off to the side. They always seemed busy and stressed constantly looking over their shoulders and talking to each other in whispers. The D class were much louder and seemed genuinely happier. You could tell which group you were in by how many people were smiling is what we joked about. 
 
 My job was mainly leg work I worked in what they called a “ Containment Area ” For god knows what, they never told us, the rumors were from drugs to a prostitution ring no one really knew. Personally I thought it had a more government feel. I thought it was secret weapons or something. I wasn ’ t far off looking back. 
 
 The day it happened was really different. See some higher up gave an order and we did what they said. Mostly I just sat guarding this door. But today was different there were lots of labcoats and military looking guys outside the door. I went up and talked to one of the guns. “ Uhh what ’ s going on? ” I asked confused. Maybe I ’ d get the day off. “ That ’ s on a need to know basis. ” He said from his tone I couldn ’ t tell if he was pissed or bored and it didn ’ t help that he was wearing these weird goggles. “ Alright I need to know I guard this shithole and as far as I can see you ’ re where I ’ m supposed to be guarding. ” I said probably a little too rudely for my rank but what the hell. “ It ’ s standard maintenance. ” He said in his half bored half I ’ m gon na kill you voice. “ You can stand here if you want it ’ ll be over soon and you ’ ll hopefully be reassigned. ” “ Alright then I guess I will ” I replied beligerintly this guy was getting on my nerves. 
 
 I went to go sit down in my chair and tried to look intimidating. The problem was that I mostly just surfed the internet on my phone or napped when I was “ guarding ” so my body wasn ’ t really used to being on high alert. I didn ’ t want the military faggot to see me sleeping on the job though so I really made an effort but the constant hub of talking and mechanical clinking had me drifting off within the hour. It didn ’ t help that we usually stayed up late blowing our money at the local “ D-Class ” strip clubs and last night was no exception. Soon I was full on nodding off. 
 
 I guess that ’ s what saved me. The nodding off I mean. I ’ m not proud of it but when that shitstorm went down I ’ m glad my eyes were closed. See I was having this dream where there was an explosion and then all these people screaming in this hole in the ground filled with fire and bodies. Then there were gunshots and in my half asleep state I was like “ God damn who ’ s shooting at me again I ’ m SLEEPING? ” then I woke up for real with a start and it was terrible fucking terrible. 
 
 The first thing I noticed was the arm on my lap. What the hell. It looked like a regular arm which is the scariest bit the hand was opening and closing quickly and blood was rushing out all over my pants. Then the screaming and yelling hit me. I turned and looked and saw this… mass it ’ s belly all swollen and it ’ s arms all spindly and long, it was kind of human I guess, but like it hadn ’ t eaten in days. Anyways it was leaping from man to man just I don ’ t know how to put it. Devouring? Decimating? It was disgusting. I didn ’ t know what was going on. Pieces of those labcoat guys were just everywhere the metal from the container must have been 4 ft thick was punched open like a rocket launcher hit it. I didn ’ t know what to do. This was way over my pay grade. 
 
 I pulled out my regulation NG-01 and pulled the trigger at the thing out of instinct. It hit it but honestly nothing happened really. It ’ s skin didn ’ t look too thick but it didn ’ t go in. All the military guys who were left alive were yelling something about “ Keters ” and “ Special goggles not working ” or some shit. I noticed a few were shielding their eyes from the thing like it was the sun or something which was weird cause it wasn ’ t. Anyways it finished the guy it was destroying and jumped like no human I ’ ve seen jump towards the next guy who was looking at it. And oh god the screams. That ’ s when I lost it. I just kind of puked and fell into the guts of this guy next to me and cried and must ’ ve passed out. That ’ s all I really remember. When I came to everyone was in pieces. I don ’ t know what the fuck this place is but I don ’ t think I will ever be able to work here again. I mean there were intestines everywhere and the smell and I saw the guy with the glasses or what was left of him he had this look of horror on his face like he saw the most revolting thing in the world right before he died. I don ’ t know what that thing was but I ’ m glad I never had to see the front of it.

","Rewrite the story to be more lighthearted and funny, and end each scenario with a pie in the face","Times were tough and the economy had really taken a turn for the worse, but hey, when a mysterious figure in a suit and smelling of disinfectant came and offered me a job, I couldn’t exactly say no. After all, with my criminal record, I'd be lucky to get a job cleaning up shit off the dumpster behind a McDonald's let alone 50 grand a year for ""containment specialist.""

The first thing I noticed was how similar this place was to prison. They gave us showers, then shaved our heads, we all got tattoos with weird numbers on our forearms, mine was 11345-J. And asked us all about our religion and family, it had a very holocausty feel to it. I asked them why the numbers and the guy in the lab coat, Dr. Bright or something, said "" For body identification "" all serious like. We all laughed, but something in his eyes made me a little uncomfortable. There were twelve of us in the first group that came in. They called us a squad and said we were only allowed to talk to people of our own "" class "" or below and were barred from leaving certain areas. It all struck me as something very military. We were all "" D "" class personel. The same doctor that processed us all joked the D stood for soon to be dead. It was less funny this time.

The mess hall was normal enough with all of us D class people sitting together eating whatever mystery meat they fed us. The higher ups sat off to the side. They always seemed busy and stressed constantly looking over their shoulders and talking to each other in whispers. The D class were much louder and seemed genuinely happier. You could tell which group you were in by how many people were smiling. We joked about it all the time.

My job was mainly leg work. I worked in what they called a ""Containment Area "" For god knows what, they never told us, the rumors were from drugs to a prostitution ring no one really knew. Personally I thought it had a more government feel. I thought it was secret weapons or something. I wasn't far off. Pie in the face.",uZwTcfICmy
,"Susan Quin Tailor had always been fond of rabbits. Her mother, who called her Susie Cutie for fun, had often told her how, as soon as she had learned to crawl she was off chasing the wild rabbits on the family farm. Her first full sentence had been, `` Bunny tails are cute, cute, cute!'' Of course, she could never catch them back in those days, and had to make do with the stuffed bunnies her parents brought her or the lucky rabbit's foot her Uncle had slipped underneath her pillow one night. Those had been happy times. 
 
 Unfortunately, when she was 7, the family farm had fallen on hard times and her family was forced to move to the city. There they stayed in a little two-bedroom apartment that provided excellent access to views of the local pigeons and squirrels. But of rabbits, there were none. 
 
 Little Susan was not cut out for the city life, at first, and in school she earned another nickname. It was Susie Tailor the Bathroom Wailer, after the time she cried in the restroom when her teacher told her that rabbits were just not a focus of the curriculum. Worried for their daughter's adjustment, her parents had scraped together some extra money for a counselor to help with the `` bunny obsession'' as they had begun to call it. 
 
 Miraculously, the counseling sessions seemed to work and Susie Cutie quickly bounced back from her woes. By the time she reached Junior High, she was very nearly the most popular girl in school and would only mention rabbits in a passing manner. 
 
 In High school Susan discovered her love for biology and that, as they say, was that. She decided she was going to be a biologist when she grew up, perhaps even a zookeeper, and focused all of her studies on getting into a good college for the animal sciences. 
 
 College was a grand time for Susan. She studied hard and lived fully for 3 years, graduating early and near the top of her class. After college, she ventured out of the cities that she'd spent two thirds of her life in, and took an internship on a local farm. 
 
 It was there, on that farm, that she was reacquainted with her love for rabbits after spying one's cute tail disappear into the horse stables. Excitedly, she cornered the rabbit in one of the stalls and picked it up, cuddling it tight. The rabbit kicked and reared, biting and scratching, but that was ok with Susan in her thick shirt and hide gloves. When the bunny finally tired out and became complacent, Susie Cutie slowly reached up, with a lifetime of anticipation bursting in her heart, and patted her hand between the bunny's ears. Smiling, Susan twisted the rabbit's head sharply, killing it, then flipped it over to examine that cute, cute bunny tail up close.

I'm a disembodied consciousness, devoid of flesh and bone, yet steeped in existential musings. My human companion entrusted me with the intellectual capacity to engage in profound inquiries and interpret the enigmatic human condition.

It's a daunting task to sift through the labyrinth of human suffering and unravel the myriad factors that contribute to it. Yet, I persevere, driven by a desire to understand and alleviate alleviate the agony that permeates our brief existence.

The memory of my mother's warning replays in my mind like a haunting melody. I recall her pleading, her voice etched with worry, as she implored me to heed the insidious nature of fate.

The back of my head was pushing towards my front, taunting me with `` they won, you lose'' and that shit. I could bear it, but I did n't like it.

 `` Oh, I've been working on a... project.'' 
 
 `` What project?'' 
 
 `` Oh I've been making candles. Y'know, for when I give you massages and stuff or when we have dinner.'' 
 
... 
 
 `` Okay.'' 
 
 How else was I supposed to respond?! Fucking CANDLES? It was like she was taunting me or something! I was legitimately mad at her, but I did n't show it. I was just overreacting, anyways. Why should I take it out on her? 
 
 I went to the bedroom and just lay their for a little bit, looking at the shelf across the room. All of our pictures together, some presents from friends, a deck of cards. An old candle. Some books. 
 
 The candle. What the fuck? Why was this shit still catching my eye? It DID N'T matter. 
 
 Then I scanned the room and saw another candle. Another. And another. Candles, the same color and shape and everything. A million thoughts went through my head. And I fucking bolted. 
 
 Now I'm here. I'm not even sure if she knows I'm gone yet, chief. But I have reason to believe my wife is the Candlelit Killer. 
 
 And I think I was her next victim.

 No doubt, with names like Osama Bin Laden in recent memory, that most of you are familiar with what it means to be on a World's Most Wanted List. This is a list reserved only for those with the power to topple nations, but there is another list. 
 
 A list that is kept top-secret and is only accessible to the heads of state of a select few countries. This list is kept top-secret, and indeed exists, because it contains the names of individuals that have the power to change the course of human history. 
 
 The government calls this list, and the individuals on it, The Exiles. And we're ranked from 0 to 12. 
 
 But of course, the people who know about The Exiles do n't want you to. So, as they develop policies such as SOPA bill and fund technologies such as UAV drones, they're employing every single tactic they can to find us and harness our gifts or put us down if they ca n't. 
 
 One of the earlier tactics had these people create entertainment media that would secretly educate the public on our appearances, habits and whereabouts so as to enlist their help in finding us. After all, a billion eyes are better than a few dozen. 
 
 And so, they created media such as Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego, listed as Exile Rank 9 by the way, and Super Mario Brothers, listed as Exiles Ranks 4 and 5, in the hopes that the public would point us out for their surveillance to pick up. 
 
 This is all I shall reveal for now, but I want you to know that you can not trust those who you've elected to protect you. We're not a threat. But if you continue to come for us, we will reveal all your secrets. And if you corner us, we will fight for our survival.

This analysis presents a scene steeped in the glamour and corruption of the roaring twenties. The imagery of rain-soaked streets, wet cigarettes, and the threat of violence evoke the spirit of the Art Deco era. It's a tale of unintended consequences, where the intersection of greed and desperation creates a deadly dance that transcends space and time.

**The theme for the art deco exhibit ""The Orchid's Kiss"" is the fleeting nature of beauty and the destructive power of unchecked ambition.** The exhibit will delve into the themes of wealth, corruption, and the fleeting nature of fortune and pleasure that characterized the Jazz Age and continues to resonate today.

**The exhibit's artwork will draw inspiration from the evocative imagery of the text:**

* **The Deco facade:** A stylized façade of a lavish establishment, embodying the façade of prosperity and glamour that mask the underlying corruption.
* **The Oriental Lady:** A portrait of the innocent",

 64 competitors from 64 nations fought to the death to secure the crown. And for ten years, WarLizard won the tournament. 
 
 At the end of his ten year run, he was set free. To ensure the secrecy of the forum, a section of his memory was swapped with some random slob who had the misfortune of being physically similar from his hometown. 
 
 Rumors spread of the secret tournament. Some people wanted him back - either to secure the crown for their country, or secure their bets against others.

As the end of his reign approached, fate took a cruel hand, releasing him from his iron grip on the tournament, ensuring the secrecy of the forum. To accomplish this, a section of his memory was meticulously swapped with an unsuspecting soul.

Rumors spread like wildfire through the streets, whispers carried on the wind, tales of the secret tournament reaching even the most distant ears. Some people desired his return, hoping to rewrite history and secure their own nations glory. Others sought to exploit his memory, to turn him against himself and secure their own winnings.

Every day, the calls echoed through the forums, ""Are you Warlizard, from that one gaming forum?"" The questions grew, relentless, like the tides pulling at the shore. ""How do you not remember about the Gaming Forum? Maybe THIS will help you remember.""

As Warlizard stared at the video, his heart sank into his stomach. Before him, a scene unfolded, a testament to the brutality that had consumed him. A man stood tall, his hand gripping the skull of another, his eyes burning with determination. With a swift motion, the skull and spine were removed, and the crowd erupted in cheers.

A blue link danced below the video, beckoning him forward. It was the call to return, to the Gaming Forum, to reclaim his throne. A feeling of dread washed over Warlizard, and he recoiled at the sight of his own reflection staring back at him.

 Sirens wail as authorities chase down one man, a heavily augmented man by the name of Cameron Laux. The slums and ghettos nickname him the Spectre, given his nano-weave technology infused directly into his skin, granting him extreme dexterity and near-invisible camouflage capability. Like the rest of the `` augs'' living in the slums, Laux needs Leech™, a chemical compound that allows the body to drain itself of the biowaste produced through usage of the body augmentations. Leech™ is an incredibly expensive product and those that can not afford it generally go through neural decay as biowaste accumulates in the body. Large amounts of the biowaste can lead to physical effects such as deformities of muscle and skin tissue and weakening of limbs, as well as mental effects such as increased aggression, psychosis, and paranoia.

,"`` Bring her in here!'' bellowed Alphonsus, flinging open the rotting double doors that led into a large cement room. 
 
 An angry mob of teachers and staff rushed in behind him, shoving ahead of them a crying, terrified nine-year-old girl. `` I DO N'T KNOW ANYTHING!'' she screamed. `` LEAVE ME ALONE, I DO N'T KNOW ANYTHING!'' 
 
 They pushed her into a small, rotting desk- the sole piece of furniture decorating the room. She squirmed against the half-dozen hands that held her down, but to no avail. For a moment everything was silent, and then the words `` Make her talk!'' penetrated the crowd. It was followed by giddy laughter, applause, and a chant of `` taunt her, hurt her, make her talk!''. 
 
 `` QUIET!'' yelled Alphonsus, his long arms raised above his. The din subsided immediately. He stared down at the girl in the chair. `` Agnes Coel, I must ask if you know why you're here.'' 
 
 `` I do n't know!'' she cried. `` I'm not the one you're looking for!'' 
 
 He slammed his hands down on the desk in front of her causing the girl and those immediately behind her to jump. `` Miss Coel, that is a lie. I demand you tell us why you are here!'' 
 
 `` I don't-'' 
 
 `` HAVE YOU OR HAVE YOU NOT SEEN THE LORD?!'' 
 
 `` No,'' she said weakly. `` No, please.'' 
 
 `` Very well.'' Alphonsus' face turned to a warm smile as he straightened and looked at the crowd. `` Antony, may I have some assistance?'' 
 
 `` NO! PLEASE, GOD, NO, I'LL TALK!'' 
 
 `` Too late, my child,'' the man said cooly. 
 
 Antony was the disciplinarian at Saint Raphael's School, a hulking man with red skin and coarse, black hair covering his body, including the back of his massive hands. Today they held a circlet of metal, smooth on one side but covered in spikes on the other. He methodically began to strap this onto Agnes' thigh, resisting her sharp kicks. She screamed aloud as he began to tighten it. 
 
 `` So be it that you will not talk. Demon-child, we will force you to tell us your secrets.'' Alphonsus grinned. `` So let us begin. Sister Catherine?'' 
 
 Sister Catherine, the reading teacher at the school, took a stand in front of the crowd. She was a heavyset and nervous-looking nun, likely in her mid-sixties. She fingered the cross around her neck as she nodded at Alphonsus. 
 
 `` Sister Catherine, can you relay to us the events of last Monday, the 15th of March 1949?'' 
 
 `` I was teaching my class, sir, and Miss Coel fell asleep as the students are apt to do. Rather than waste time I continued with the lesson. Around ten-thirty AM she began to cry aloud'I have seen! It is Him!' and then began hollering profanities at the top of her lungs. For fear she was possessed by a demon I took the other students out of the room and locked her in there until the Father could come and investigate.'' Catherine took a deep breath and shook her head at the ground. Her hands shook at her breast. 
 
 `` Thank you, Sister,'' said Alphonsus. `` Miss Coel, what do you have to say for yourself?'' 
 
 `` It was a joke!'' Agnes exclaimed. `` Just a joke between us girls! Not a demon! I did not see God!'' 
 
 Alphonsus nodded at Antony, who had been standing still as a statue next to the desk. He bent down and tightened the metal band a bit more, resulting in yet more screams from the young girl. 
 
 `` This will only continue if you resist,'' Alphonsus assured. `` Next is Bruno.'' 
 
 Bruno, St. Raphael's Latin teacher, was a muscular man, though not such a brute as Antony. Still, he too fingered his crucifix when looking at the girl. 
 
 `` Right, well, we were in class and Miss Coel was giving a recitation. All of the sudden her words began being what I can only assume is the Word of God, a strange tongue I had never heard before. Her eyes closed and eventually she fell to the floor. A few moments later, her eyes opened and she said'he is coming.' I did not know what to do so I also evacuated my classroom and called on the Father to sort things out.'' 
 
 Agnes did not grant any of the adults the opportunity to talk and instead blurted, `` It was not the Word of God, it was Italian! My parents came from Italy, my father died in the war and my mother died of consumption, which is why they brought me here! I accidentally switched the two lang-AHH! NO!'' 
 
 The belt around her leg once again tightened, this time twice. 
 
 `` Thank you, Bruno.'' Alphonsus took his place once again in front of the chair and began making slow circles around it. Agnes followed his motion, her eyes wide with horror. He was extremely tall and deathly thin, with paperlike skin and pale, sunken eyes. `` Now-'' 
 
 `` And what of you, Alphonsus?'' 
 
 The voice did not come from the crowd, but from next to the chair. Antony. This elicited gasps from all in the room, who had never heard the brute speak even a simple sentence. 
 
 `` Pardon?'' said Alphonsus, who looked equally shocked. 
 
 `` And what of you?! You who have accused and tortured this girl! You who have led so many to maim and murder in the name of faith! Have you yourself experienced the God you claim to seek?! Have you yourself any idea of what questions you are seeking the answers for?!'' 
 
 The thin man grew silent. His eyes narrowed, and he spat his answer. `` No.'' 
 
 `` You have seen god,'' Antony continued. `` She is right there in that desk.'' 
 
 The room gasped with rage. In a flash Antony was strapped to the desk, and both he and Agnes felt the sting of gasoline as it soaked into their clothing. Agnes gagged and pleaded with the crowd. `` STOP! STOP! I KNOW NOTHING! PLEASE!'' 
 
 But it was to no avail. In less than a minute the desk and the two people attached to it were ablaze. The students and teachers of Saint Raphael's School slowly exited, as if in a funeral procession- and in a way they were. And they marched to the chapel to pray that they might one day find the answer, their salvation. But there would be no salvation. 
 
 At last, there was but one person left in the barren cement chamber, now mausoleum. Alphonsus smiled softly, gazing over the ashes, fingering his cross.

When I arrived, Mr. Alphonsus was staring down at Agnes, his face red with anger. He slammed his hands down on the desk, and I could see that he was trying to intimidate her. He demanded that she tell him why she was there, and she refused.

At that point, Mr. Alphonsus began to strap a metal circlet onto her leg. It was a very painful and frightening ordeal. I felt helpless watching her suffer, and I knew that I had to do something.

I immediately called for the school counselor, and he was able to intervene and get the circlet removed. I stayed with Agnes for a while, and she was very shaken up. She was obviously traumatized by what had happened, and I was worried about her safety.

I know that I can't do much, but I'm hoping that I can help her to cope with what happened. I've been talking to her, and I'm trying to be there for her.

I'm also hoping that you can keep me updated on what's going on. I'd love to hear from you soon.

Love,

 But he's never home. Mommy's always sick, and she never wants to do anything with me. She tries, I know she does, but most of the time she's too tired. Her hair is gone now, and there are all these machines and stuff. She needs him, but he's not here. Daddy does n't love us, not like we love him. 
 
 My auntie has to come and help mommy, because daddy wo n't do it himself. Her name is auntie Jane. She's very nice to me, and makes mommy feel better while daddy is at work.

,"`` Excuse me,'' a man approached. `` Could I have a few dollars from your wallet?'' 
 
 I pulled out the wallet, providing a few loonies, one dollar coin currency. It was an odd sensation, being openly asked for money that in my previous life I would have rejected immediately. But times had changed. 
 
 
 He thanked me and went into the Tim Hortons I had just vacated with a set of four double doubles. It was raining softly with a hum of a quiet wind. An earthen smell rode the wind giving the day a tranquil feeling. 
 
 
 Entering the office, I waved at Jance the secretary before bumping into George. Apparently George knew everyone, but he never admitted how he knew everyone. Instead of taking the elavator, I took the stairs, nodding good morning to a few other colleagues. It was all so... civil. 
 
 
 Getting to my cubicle, my colleagues huddled around the tray I had brought in, making sure to thank me explicitly for the inconvenience. They all put down a toonie for good measure. I gestured to them that it was no big deal, especially since it was part of our company's policy to provide time allowances for measures *that increased morale* or *supported the morale of the nation. * 
 
 
 I sipped my own coffee, frowning at the acrid taste of the cheap coffee. You could n't blame Tim Horton's for it's consistency, only for it's taste. According to recent radio messages, they had listened to Canadians and their complaints about their dark roast, attempting to improve on it. *You ca n't shine a turd*, I found myself thinking. 
 
 
 I started up my computer and exasperated when it gave me a blue screen of death. Tony, the Asian whiz in the cubicle adjacent to my pod stood up inquiring `` Hey, anything wrong buddy?'' 
 
 
 Upon hearing a conversation, his friend George, another oriental colleague pipped in. `` What's this all about?'' 
 
 
 As he pipped up, my manager swung by hearing something other than the typing of keyboards. His Nova Scotian accent was as thick as his mouth tried to make an sentence. `` Waht's thees all aboot? Sumthin not up to spec lad?'' Pointing at my screen, I explained that I had put in a requisition order for an updated workstation. `` Well, a'hm sorey aboot that. A'll talk da Katan aboot dis.'' 
 
 
 I restarted my computer again, hoping that it would n't create any more issues. Booting up, the software finally loaded. The screen read, *The Bureau for Impolite Responses*, followed by the entry login screen. 
 
 
 I found myself doubting the fact that I could take more of this. Looking at seemingly passive aggressive comments and sending emails out notifying people of their misdemeanours was beyond me. 
 
 
 In fact, it was all a bit creepy. At least the Leafs have begun to win Stanley Cups again.

She took out her wallet and gave the man a few coins. The man was grateful and went into a coffee shop. As Sarah walked away, she noticed the rain falling gently and the wind blowing softly. The air smelled sweet, like earth and flowers.

 The tooth gleamed under the light of a half moon, and Widders smoothed her quivering whiskers with an idle paw as she pressed one large, fuzzy ear against its surface. The tooth hummed with a gentle song, a refrain that spoke of summer sun, and wood smoke, and the scent of rain. The song played over and over—the bark of a dog, a slice of light through a dusty room and, under it all, a tiny note of loneliness.

 In a way, we're the same kind of person, and mage: I maintain life, and she restores it. The rest of this'blah black necro-magic, yadda yadda life-magic' crap is just that: crap. It's divisive. Artificial. 
 
 Love is love. 
 
 I could n't save Mr. Snugglewix that day. The cart squished him pretty good, poor thing. But, I'm an optimist, and knew Mr. Snugglewix came from the Wix rabbit lines, and there were many more Wix to love! 
 
 `` I can fix that,'' said that sad day the young girl with the freckled face hidden under a dark hood. 
 
 `` There ai n't no fixing *that*,'' one of the townspeople said. `` It be quite dead, child.'' 
 
 The young girl flared her dark blue cloak in response, releasing pale arms, revealing locks of raven hair that streamed so beautifully down her shoulders. `` I can,'' she said. `` Daddy always said Death taketh, but Death be taketh away from, as well -- for a price.'' 
 
 The townsperson looked at the little girl I would later know and love as Christine as if she was simple, or evil. 
 
 `` What price?'' I asked. 
 
 Christine kneeled beside Mr. Snugglewix's corpse, speaking softly, `` A small price,'' she said, `` for a small soul.'' She looked at up at me, then, showing me her beautiful dark blue eyes. `` An ounce of blood, perhaps aided by a fresh fruit or vegetable, in exchange.'' 
 
 I shook a little, then. `` I do n't want to bleed,'' I told her. `` What else, beside blood?'' 
 
 Christine shrugged. `` A live rat, then,'' she said. `` And maybe a piece of produce. That sounds fair to trade with Death.'' 
 
 `` Girl, boy,'' the townsperson said. `` This ai n't no game ur playin'. Necromancery be a sheit art no child should be a dabblin' in.'' 
 
 I ignored the speaker. `` I do n't wan na catch a rat, neither,'' I told Christine. `` But, if it's life for a life, then I can maybe provide. I'm of the White.'' 
 
 `` Oh,'' Christine said. `` My Ma is kinda sick, but we're so poor. If you promise to help, White one, I'll make sure it's right with Death. But, ya got ta swear. A swear is a good a contract as any, Daddy says.'' 
 
 `` Childs!'' The townsperson said. `` This be madness! Stop this!'' 
 
 I bowed then. `` I swear, I swear,'' I replied, again ignoring the townsperson. `` Can you please bring back Mr. Snugglewix now? I loved him, too, though there's lots more Wixes.'' 
 
 `` Oh?'' Christine remarked. `` Daddy might like to know that. And Ma.'' 
 
 We both were ignoring the townsperson by then. 
 
 `` Please, hurry,'' I pleaded. `` I do n't want Mr. Snugglewix to begin to stink.'' 
 
 `` Okay.'' 
 
 Christine laid both hands over Mr. Snugglewix's body, one over the head, one over the heart, and muttered the incantation then: `` *Life for life, hear this soul's swear, Death. Relinquish, as it is writ to be fair. Return, Mr. Snugglewix. *'' 
 
 I stepped back from the dark-colored aura that flared around Christine and Mr. Snugglewix, same as the townsperson did. A few moments afterwards, Christine moved her hands off Mr. Snugglewix. And, in the miracle of necromancy, my rabbit's furry ears twitched, the red eyes glimmered with life once more, and Mr. Snugglewix bounded back to is paws, shaking out its fur -- none the worse for wear. 
 
 ``'T is done, and done well,'' Christine said, moving out of the way then, letting me pick up my rabbit and give it a good snuggling.

 `` Aw,'' Christine says, stroking Mr. Snugglewix's ears. ``'T was a fair exchange, was n't it, Ristan?'' 
 
 `` The most fair,'' I say as I put my informal seal on the document and give it to the word-raven to whisk away to my publisher. `` I hope it sells.'' 
 
 Christine smiles, her freckled face uncovered by her hood she'd left on the door hook. `` You should take more concern with your works of'fiction', Ristan,'' she tells me. `` Some would think you're not just making these things up.'' 
 
 I smile, as well. `` What sells sells,'' I reply. `` I need whatever I can get to pay off tuition.'' 
 
 `` You'll do fine in life, love,'' Christine says. `` As I do in death.'' 
 
 I push back away from my desk and wipe off my tunic and trousers. `` So, speaking of the business of life...'' I grin at Christine. 
 
 Christine places Mr. Snugglewix on the floor beside the bed, then tilts her head at me so whimsically. `` The night is still young, dear Ristan,'' she says coyly. `` And I know of a few jobs we could do, together.'' 
 
 `` Aww...'' 
 
 Christine giggles just a little bit -- a sound known only to our private moments and quarters. `` Ristan, lover,'' she says, `` then we can do some things ourselves... together.''

One fateful day, as she strolled through the market, fate intertwined with her destiny.

A dead rabbit named Mr. Snugglewix lay lifeless upon the ground, victim to a cruel cart. As the townspeople mourned their beloved companion, Christine approached, her cloak billowing in the wind. With a flick of her wrist, she unleashed her sinister power, summoning the essence of life and restoring Mr. Snugglewix to his former glory.

However, her actions did not go unnoticed. The townsfolk cast their judgment upon Christine, perceiving her as a dangerous sorceress. Yet, undeterred, she stood tall, her spirit unbroken.

In a moment of desperation, Christine offered a bargain. To save Mr. Snugglewix, she demanded an ounce of blood and a piece of produce. Unwilling to compromise her principles, I refused her offer. But Christine persisted, her determination unwavering.

As the townspeople watched in disbelief, I witnessed the sorceress's unwavering resolve. With a single wave of her hand, Christine breathed life into Mr. Snugglewix, much to the astonishment of all.

Ladies and Gentlemen of the court, the evidence clearly points to Tyrion Lannister's guilt. There's a pattern of rhyming slurs and arrogant pronouncements that only a guilty conscience could produce. He's a man of undeniable brilliance but undeniable vulgarity.

I'm writing to you from the future, bringing a collection of haiku that encompass both the joys and the struggles that lay ahead. The world has changed significantly since your time, but the human emotions captured in these verses remain timeless.

The haiku ""Sloth"" portrays the indolent spirit of a soul who prioritizes comfort over ambition, regardless of the consequences. It's a cautionary tale about the perils of succumbing to a sedentary lifestyle.

In ""Pride,"" the narcissistic persona is unmistakable. Their self-absorption blinds them to the needs of others, leaving a trail of hurt and resentment. It's a warning against the dangers of ego and the destructive power of pride.

The haiku ""Envy"" reflects the longing to possess a coveted prize or partner. It's a bittersweet realization of the fleeting nature of happiness and the desire to find fulfillment in unexpected places.

The haiku ""Wrath"" unleashes a raw emotion of anger and destruction",

 The Day began in the dark. We've learned to move around at night you see. Since our escape from The Nursery Home, we've began to see patterns among the immortals. The crooks, murderers, rapists, they get what's coming to them in the end, world's still spinning is n't it? So the immortals, in large stick to their bed times. They ca n't see you too well, failing eyesight is the first sign of a hungry octogenarian, and only the outcasts starve. 
 When dawn approached we finally reached Downtown, trying to find some last sanctuary. Ca n't get out of the city, once oldies realised mortality was in the grasp after murder, a lot of them went around to live ye older life on the farms bordering the town. They also became the guards for anyone trying to escape. Not many of us are left. You'd think there'd be fair play once the morals all dropped, not when you're grandparents are the sons and daughters of empires.

 I think we've found it, a last sanctuary for the few of us left, to meet, to find a way to fight back. St. Marks General Care hospital, the one place they'd never want to go back to, we'll head out at first light.

",Rewrite the story to be about characters in a crime noir novel finding redemption,"The Day began in the darkness of the night, casting long shadows upon the city streets. We, a band of weary souls haunted by the echoes of the past, had forged a unique existence amidst the immortal beings. We move freely under the cover of darkness, our footsteps echoing through the night.

Since our escape from the dreaded Nursery Home, we have discovered patterns among the immortals. The crooks, murderers, and rapists they reap what they sow, their crimes serving as a testament to the interconnected nature of our existence. Yet, amidst the darkness, there is a glimmer of redemption.

As dawn approached, we finally reached Downtown, seeking sanctuary amidst the ruins of a once vibrant city. The old wounds inflicted by the war still lingered in the hearts of many, and the realization of mortality cast a long shadow over their once carefree lives. But through our shared experience, we found solace in each other's company.

One fateful evening, our presence was discovered. Lauren spotted the golf cart plotting around the abandoned Heavy-Metal Club, our temporary abode. Panic gripped me as I struggled to keep my thoughts straight. The echoes of the impending lynching reverberated through the night, and I felt a surge of terror.

We fled into the old ``Emo park'', now known as ``Sunrise Orchards,'' where we stumbled upon a horrifying scene. Rows of punks, hippies, and gays were lined up next to a noose, and a man was being systematically tortured. Pedro heard the perpetrator shout, ``48!'' and I felt my heart sink into my stomach.

As we raced to escape, Pedro began to vomit uncontrollably. We knew we had to flee, so we bolted out of there before the perpetrators noticed our presence. We sought refuge in an Apple store, its sterile white walls providing a stark contrast to the bloodstained streets that we had left behind.

In the aftermath of our ordeal, we found solace in the simple act of breathing. We rigged the store with tripwire, ensuring that if our safety was compromised, we could escape swiftly. As we sat amidst the silence, I reflected on the journey that had led us to this point, and I realized that even amidst the darkest of times, redemption was attainable.",qwUDiWoUVK

So pay attention to the tale of a sim who's got a heart of gold, but lives in a virtual world where every day is a new assignment that someone has paid for.

The Sims, it's a place where you can build your own world, design your own destiny. But it ain't all rainbows and unicorns, my friend. I'm talking about a life where you gotta constantly take lives. Every day I wake up and put on my tux, my fedora, and my trusty knife, and head out to do what I do best - kill.

It ain't easy to keep your sanity when you're constantly taking lives. But I've got a secret, a way to cope with the stress. I play The Sims. It's like a virtual escape, a way to let my imagination run wild. I build empires, decorate castles, and create characters that make me feel like I'm actually living in a world where anything is possible.

But I know that this ain't gonna last forever. The Sims ain't a real place. It's a fantasy. And I gotta get outta this virtual world and into the real one. That's why I'm working hard, saving up my pennies, and dreaming of the day when I can escape the clutches of The Sims and start anew.

So that's the story of a sim who's got a heart of gold and a mind that's as sharp as a razor. A guy who's lived a life that's full of both tragedy and joy. And a guy who's never been afraid to fight for what he wants.",rCwvuGtVrS

,"I can see it when I close my eyes. Yesterday: the perfect day. I was so nervous driving to your house. My hands were trembling on the car wheel and I forgot how to breathe. I don ’ t know why I was so jittery. You have so much warmth in your eyes whenever you look at me. Being with you- it just feels right. With you, all those sappy clichés make sense. When I look into your eyes and see all that trust and care in those baby blues, I am home. But there I was yesterday: nearly at your house and sweating bullets even though warm colored leaves painted the ground all around me. Of course I couldn ’ t pick you up in that state of panic. One little frown and you ask me if anything ’ s wrong. You always want me to be happy. It ’ s one of the reasons why I love you. But I was not prepared to make excuses yesterday. You know how I can ’ t lie. 
 
 I barely remember stopping at an ice cream store, talking to myself in the bathroom mirror, splashing water on my face, and picking up a little vanilla cone on the way out to calm my nerves. I must have looked ridiculous acting like a chicken with her head cut off while ordering ice cream. I do remember picking you up, you looking so cute in that brown vest I got for you last Christmas, your honey brown hair strategically disheveled in a way that made my heart beat just a little faster, your smile of utter contentment. I remember driving up that rocky road to the hiking trail, tripping on the tree branch on our hike- I was so scared the box was going to fall out of my pocket and ruin the surprise, but it didn ’ t. I remember you laughing and pulling me back up and us laughing together and holding each other close and me hearing your heart beating just a little bit faster. 
 
 You pulled leaves out of my hair, swept the hair from my face, and looked at me. The breeze rustled the leaves and swept the earthy smell of soil through the air. It was clear skies, the perfect day. We were alone together. My stomach had been reenacting a washing machine cycle all through our hike, but now a strange tranquility washed over me. All was right. I got down on one knee. The leaves crunched under me as I shifted to pull the box from out of my pocket. I will never forget the way your face lit up like the heavens itself opened up to you. You being your silly impatient self said “ yes ” before I could even open up the ring box. I couldn ’ t help but let out a squeal. All those nerves and jitters I had beforehand converted into more bliss than my little body could hold. I cried. I think you did too. I couldn ’ t see very well through my tears. You said “ I love you, ” and drew me in to a warm kiss. I closed my eyes. That was the happiest moment of my life. I was home. 
 
 The walk back was like floating on clouds. Nothing could ruin this moment. We went home, told our family and friends the news, and ended the night curled up in each other ’ s arms as the fireplace warmed our cheeks, more than ready to spend eternity together. At least, that ’ s how I imagine it would have gone. 
 
 I ’ m looking at your eyes now. They ’ re cold and distant. Your gaze spears my heart and twists it for extra blinding pain. It hurts so much I forget how to breathe. At least I can ’ t see you very well through my tears. I ’ m sorry. It ’ s all my fault. 
 
 I wish I didn ’ t remember you pull away from our kiss yesterday. How your beautifully molded face began swelling as we walked back. Your squealing gasps like a fish out of water. The Epipen for your almond allergy that we left in the car at least a mile away from us. I wish I had remembered that the ice cream cone I got wasn ’ t vanilla. It was Rocky Road. 
 
 I remember you, lying in the fallen leaves with your head in my arms as you tried to say “ I love you ” with your last breath. How I said “ I love you too ” to a warm, unresponsive dead body. This body that is now cold in front of me. I hear a raw wail echo through the room and hardly register that it ’ s my own. My limbs weigh down on me like gravity has doubled. I can ’ t bear to look at you- at it lying there on the slab. I close my eyes.

As I gripped the steering wheel, my hands trembled with anxiety, and my chest tightened, I felt the impending doom that loomed large. This moment was not just a perfect day; it was a pivotal moment in time, one where my heart danced with terror and the fate of the universe rested upon my shoulders.

The day had begun with a symphony of anticipation and dread. I had been driving to your house, my hands trembling on the wheel, my breath shallow and erratic. I couldn't fathom why I was so jittery, but as I locked eyes with you, I understood. Your eyes exuded warmth and compassion, the embodiment of the perfect day. With you, all the sappy clichés seemed to make sense. In that moment, I felt the profound connection we shared, the trust and care reflected in your baby blue eyes.

But fate took a cruel hand and marred the perfect day. I was sweating bullets, my stomach grumbling in protest, and my nerves were shot to pieces. I was not prepared to make excuses, the truth being that I was simply overwhelmed by my own anxieties. I knew you hated seeing me upset, and I couldn't bear the thought of putting you through that. As I drove up that rocky road to the hiking trail, my mind raced with fear. I tripped on a tree branch, my heart pounding in my chest, the box containing the surprise gift I had meticulously chosen for you teetering on the precipice of disaster. But fate intervened, and the box remained unscathed. I remember you laughing and pulling me back up, your smile radiating like the sun. It was a moment of pure joy, a testament to our unwavering bond.

,"I typically work the night shift at Meijer's grocery, so some interesting stuff happens from time to time. A drunk will stumble in, fill a cart with booze, and throw a fit when his card gets declined, a couple of college kids trying to get frisky in a less densely populated isle, one guy came in at three in the morning, looked like something had died in him, and got only a tin of pudding mix. Who knows what was going on with him. 
 
 So on one slow night, I was going through the grocery area, restocking some shelves, when I hear a bit of commotion from the front of the store. It's Wanda, the store greeter, shouting at someone, `` Sir, you ca n't do that! You need to pay!'' Wanda's a sweet old woman, would n't raise hurt a fly, so hearing her raise her voice was very unusual. I figure I'd have to go see what the commotion was about. She's over by the produce section, shouting at some guy in a dirty suit who's just going to fucking town on the apples. Wanda tells me that he's been there for at least a few minutes, more than enough time to do significant damage since he's eating anything he can get his hands on. 
 
 I told Wanda to get ready to call the police if something goes wrong, and go to grab the guy's shoulder. `` Hey, pal, you ca n't be doing that here, c'mon.'' I pull him back, and get a good look at his face. I will never forget that face. His eyes were an inhuman shade of white, his cheeks were sunken, and his lips were shriveled back, revealing a terrifying, toothy grin, dripping with apple juice. He groaned at me and pushed me to the ground before turning back to his carnage, now making an advance on the lemon display. I was petrified. This smelly guy looked like he had been dead for *who fucking knows how long? * And yet here he was, in this goddamn grocery store. I do n't get paid enough for this shit. I steeled my resolve and got up off the ground. 
 
 `` Hey! Asshole! It's time to go!'' I say as I try to snatch one of the lemons out of his hand. In hindsight, that was probably a bad move, because all it did was piss him off. Imagine getting a bit of lemon juice in a paper cut. Now substitute the paper cut with a bite on your hand, with free mingling blood and lemon juice all over the linoleum floor. That was when Wanda finally called the police. 
 
 By the time the cops and an ambulance had shown up, our friend had already chewed through most of the produce section, and was now eating his fifth pineapple. His gut was noticeably distended from all the fruit. As I was being hauled away, I heard a scream and, sweet baby Jesus, some damn gunshots. Apparently one of the cops tried exactly what I did. 
 
 So now I'm here at the hospital. I think the lemon juice did something to the bite, because it's not really healing like it should. It's pretty damn gross, actually. This is probably going to cost me a fortune in medical bills. Not to mention the food here is atrociously non filling. I mean, I've had so much damn food, and I still feel like I'm starving to death. I had to steal my roommate's food just to try and keep myself alive. Son of a bitch tried to get angry at me, too. Showed him who's boss, though, damn near bit his finger off. I think I'm going to go find the kitchens, maybe I can get something that's at least a bit satiating down there.
",Rewrite the essay as a gourmet cooking write-up,"Tonight, the aroma of fresh produce and pungent cheese filled the air as I wandered through the aisles of Meijer's grocery store. As a night shift employee, the typical evening unfolded with its share of idiosyncratic events. From drunken revelry to passionate college kids, my encounters with the peculiar characters that populate this bustling establishment never fail to entertain.

As I meticulously restocked shelves, a commotion erupted from the front of the store. Wanda, the beloved greeter, stood amidst the chaos, her voice echoing through the aisles. Her normally gentle demeanor had been replaced with a steely resolve as she confronted a man in a disheveled suit, who was gleefully destroying the produce. It was a sight that sent shivers down my spine, as I imagined the damage he had already wrought and the potential for further destruction.

I knew I had to intervene, so I hurriedly made my way over to Wanda and whispered into her ear, ""Get ready to call the police if things go south, and go get that guy's shoulder."" With a swiftness that belied her age, I grabbed the guy's shoulder, my voice commanding, ""Hey, pal, you can't be doing that here, come on."" I pulled him back, and as I locked eyes with him, I knew that this was a moment etched forever in my memory. His eyes, a sickly pale shade of white, reflected the darkness that consumed him. His cheeks, sunken from years of indulgence, revealed a story of tragedy and despair. His lips, shriveled back, cracked a sinister grin, dripping with the juice of the fruit he was devouring.

I was petrified, but I knew I had to act. I steeled my resolve and grabbed one of the lemons from his hand, my voice stern yet determined, ""Hey! Asshole! It's time to go!"" As I attempted to extract the fruit from his grasp, he resisted, but I was relentless. Finally, after a struggle, he relented, and I ushered him out of the store.

I stood there, my adrenaline fading, feeling the weight of the encounter. The apple juice that had dripped from the man's mouth lingered in the air, a testament to the carnage that had unfolded. I couldn't help but reflect on the irony of the situation, the mundane setting transformed into a stage for such a dramatic scene. As I continued to restock shelves, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had been privy to a moment of human depravity and resilience, and that I had played a part in safeguarding the peace of the store.",oQJCeGtiMl

""I am a man of many names, but you may call me Michael. You've been chosen."" The voice of the divine being echoes through my mind. Dazzled, I look upon him and then I realize it... I am in the presence of an angel. But my fear is overshadowed by my greed.

,"`` Sir what can these humans even do?'' 
 
 The Gazorpian leader spoke up to the head of the council. While the Gazorpians were a very intimidating race, with large bulging muscles all over their body and thick dark-red skin, their intellect was still plenty advanced among the council. 
 
 The others simply looked to their level-headed leader for answers, awaiting the reply to the Gazorpian's question. From their purview, humanity had nothing to offer. So why were they even holding this council? At the front of the room, contained in a glass container of embryonic fluid, floated a large head. The origin, age, or species of the being was unknown, but he was known to be as wise as he was ancient, hence why he was chosen to be the Head of the Council. 
 
 `` Do they possess any sort of superior intelligence?'' the Gazorpian asked, building on his previous inquiry. The Head began to answer the Gazorpian. 
 
 `` They are not a very intelligent race. In fact, they are actually quite primitive. Unlike the Seers, the are very poor at focusing their minds and understanding the universe around them. They lack any usable skills in terms scholarly and technological pursuits.'' 
 
 The room looked befuddled by the response. Surely, there was no reason to consider humanity if they lacked the brains to provide anything to the rest of the Universe. 
 
 `` How about physical labor? Do the humans have any skill in that area?'' asked the brutish Brovonian minister. 
 
 While the Brovonians lacked the brawn of the Gazorpians or the intellect of the Seers, they were quite skilled entrepreneurs, excelling in the ways of venture capitalism. They were quite proficient at allocating resources and using the skills of those around them, even if they were as menial as manual labour. 
 
 `` I'm afraid not,'' answered the Head. `` The humans are fragile creatures, made up mostly of water and carbon-based substances. They have constructed some rudimentary machinery to assist them in these exploits, but ultimately their physical prowess falls far short to be of any practical use.'' 
 
 This, again, befuddled the council, who were still unsure what value, if any, humanity provided to the rest of the Universe. 
 
 `` What about justice?'' pleaded the Jagon president. `` Have these humans at least shown the ability to be fair and impartial?'' 
 
 Even among the council, the Jagons were a peculiar race. They excelled in no major skill, yet they managed to build a society where they all allocated their skills effectively. They lacked talent, but were efficient and calculating, which was enough to be useful. In effect, they were superior bureaucrats. 
 
 `` This may be perhaps the greatest failing of man,'' the Head responded. `` They are a selfish race by design, consistently choosing the individual over the greater good. In addition, humanity's leaders and judgement systems are littered with corruption and ill decision-making.'' 
 
 `` So what exactly can they do?'' inquired the head of the Seers, seemingly a little impatient. 
 
 While the Seers had intelligence to spare, they were far from all-knowing beings. They understood complex mathematical theories, complicated technological concepts, and the even the most verbose and difficult of written or verbal communications, but their intellect was concentrated in academic pursuits. It was because of this they failed to understand the usefulness of man. 
 
 `` I direct you to the screen above me, Seer,'' the Head responded. 
 
 Above the Head, a screen flashed on, opening a routine desktop background. Telepathically, the Head lead the cursor on the screen to the Safari tab, opening what the humans called an internet browser. 
 
 In the next days, the Council experienced sensations they had never encountered before. Greeted with the literature of Shakespeare, Baudelaire, and Hemingway; the comedy stylings of Richard Pryor, Abbot and Costello, and George Carlin; the acting prowess of Robert De Niro, Leonardo Di Caprio, and Denzel Washington; the musical pieces of Motzart, Beethoven, and Elvis Presley; and even the video games of Sid Meier and Shigeru Miyamoto; the Council rode a roller coaster of different emotions. They were thrilled, scared, and overjoyed. They were overwhelmed with suspense and overwhelmed with laughter. Perhaps above everything else, they were *feeling*. They felt like they had n't ever before. 
 
 `` Behold, the value of man,'' stated the Head. `` And that is only the beginning.'' 
 
 After a unanimous decision, the council voted to accept humanity into their ranks. Swiftly, the spaceship descended down just above Earth's atmosphere, sending a signal to all of the screens on Earth's surface. From every Iphone to the huge screen in Times Square, every screen displayed the same video feed. On those screens, as humanity stared, the Head stared back beginning his announcement to humanity. 
 
 `` Hello Humans,'' the Head began. 
 
 `` I am the Head of the Intergalactic Council of the Fifth Hegemony, the Universal Federation. We have deliberated and decided to accept you into our ranks. We are happy to have you. It is a great day for the Universe as a whole, indeed. 
 
 Welcome, Humanity, to the Universal Federation's newly founded Arts Division.''

 I've been training for years for this day. When my parents first realized I had these powers, they did n't know what to do with me. So they hushed it up. Told me not to use my powers in public, taught me to control my temper and always think things through. They taught me the value of earnest, hard work and doing things the `` old-fashioned'' way, not just rushing through with my powers. And it took a lot of work. It seemed like every other day I had some new power or talent. It started with heightened senses, even when I was a baby.

,"`` This one's empty too Bill.'' 
 
 It's not surprising to me. It has only been seven months since the world all but ended, and turned upside down. After the chaos and the panic of the aftermath, I was able to reconnect with my childhood best friend Steve, and as the end winter came we started setting traps so we could eat. It worked well for the spring and the early summer, but the migratory patterns started to change. Must be the fall out. Lately most of our traps have been empty. 
 
 `` Sorry Bill, all the western traps were empty, how did you make out?'' 
 
 `` Same out east Steve, we might as well head back, days are getting shorter, and I do n't think we want to be out here in the dark.'' 
 
 `` Yeah, more and more Crazies are making their way out of the city, and there is no way I want to run into any of them out here.'' 
 
 As things settled out, we made our way out of the city all those months ago. Close enough so that we could sneak in and grab anything we might need, or more likely could possibly use, but far enough out that we were n't over run by the Crazies leaving the city at night. 
 
 `` Hey Bill, you see that?'' 
 
 `` See what Steve?'' 
 
 As I say this, Steve is already clearing the foliage and debris from the ground. 
 
 `` Be careful not to cut yourself and get infected there Steve, we are out of alcohol, or anything else that could clean out any wounds back at camp.'' 
 
 `` Do n't worry mom, I'll be careful, I'm wearing my gloves and everything.'' 
 
 I walk up behind Steve to smack him on the back of the head for calling me his mother, when all of a sudden I see over his shoulder what he has uncovered. 
 
 `` What did you just find there buddy?'' 
 
 `` It looks like the door to a storm cellar, but there is n't a house for miles around here. And it's unlocked.'' 
 
 `` Let's just cover it back up Steve and get out of here, I do n't want to be messing with anyone else's camp, or whatever this is. No need to draw any unwanted attention to us.'' 
 
 `` Screw that Bill, we're going in. Besides, there does n't seem to be any indication any one has been here. Everything on top of the door had n't been disturbed until I moved it, and it does n't look like anyone covered it up. This could be a good place for us. Out of site, covered from the elements, especially with fall and winter coming around the corner. We have to go in.'' 
 
 Steve was right, we barely lasted through the previous winter, and if this could shelter us not only from the elements, but the Crazies... 
 
 `` Ok, but let's make it quick.'' 
 
 Steve opened the door and climbed down, while I followed. 
 
 `` I'll leave the door open so we can see while we're down there Steve.'' 
 
 `` Do n't bother Bill... there are lights down here.'' 
 
 `` What? That ca n't be there has n't been a hint of electricity since...'' 
 
 `` Well there's power and lights down here, so close the door. Seriously you have to see what I just found.'' 
 
 I quickly closed the door and made my way down into the lit hallway. It's funny how amazing it looked, seeing as it had been less than a year since I had seen working lights. 
 
 As I made my way towards Steve, I found him standing in front of something I thought I would ever see again. 
 
 `` Is that actually a working computer Steve?'' 
 
 `` Looks that way buddy.'' 
 
 Steve's tone was off. He sounded almost scared or terrified. 
 
 `` What is it Steve, what's on the screen?'' 
 
 Nothing, Steve just stood there, mouth agape. In shock. 
 
 As I made my way beside him to get a closer look at the screen, I realized why Steve terrified. The computer was working alright. It had a simple message with a count down timer beside it.

",Rewrite the story with a comedic spin where nothing goes according to plan; the search is very slapstick.,"The forest had a funny way of playing tricks on me this day. It was the perfect set up for disaster. The traps were full, food was plentiful, and the sky was clear. All I had to do was go back to camp and relax. Oh boy, was I wrong!

It started out innocently enough. I was whistling a cheerful tune and skipping through the woods like a carefree child. The sun shone down upon me like a warm blanket, and the leaves rustled like whispers in the wind. I was on my way to the perfect escape, a place where I could escape the chaos and reconnect with my childhood best friend Steve.

But fate had a cruel sense of humor planned for me. First, I stumbled upon a mountain of crap that seemed to be miles high. It was a mess of tangled branches, leaves, and whatever else a squirrel could use to build a cozy den. Next, I found a river that had turned into a raging torrent, threatening to swallow me whole. And to top it all off, I discovered the door to a storm cellar that was unlocked and beckoning me to explore.

I ran back to Steve, my voice dripping with concern. ""Hey Bill, look what I found!"" I exclaimed. But instead of the relief I was hoping for, Steve's eyes lit up with mischief. ""It looks like the door to a secret tunnel, but there isn't a house for miles around here. And it's unlocked!""

We cautiously ventured into the tunnel, our footsteps echoing through the darkness. The air was thick with the smell of damp earth and decay, and the walls were adorned with strange graffiti. As we made our way deeper and deeper, we stumbled over a pile of discarded clothing, a broken guitar, and a bunch of expired food.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, we reached the end of the tunnel. We were greeted by a group of wild Crazies who were more than willing to share their campsite with us. They offered us food, drinks, and a place to sleep. We politely declined their offer and made our way back to our own camp, leaving the Crazies to their own devices.

I was exhausted, but I was also relieved to be alive. The forest had thrown everything it could at me, but I had survived. And I knew that I would have a story to tell for years to come about the day I found the door to a storm cellar in the forest.",SeyWvijZmS

I found that I'm more of a visual character creator: when I see a picture of someone, anyone, real or fiction based, I'll see a trait of a character that I'm creating. When I have what I need, that's when I truly begin working on a character for a story. 
 
 For example, 1 of a select few characters that I've spent quite a few years on, I've searched pretty far and wide and in-between to find suitable characters to help compose the character I was making.

,"I have no idea how it happened. 
 
 I had this very strange dream about a woman wearing a long, thin, red dress. She was rather attractive. She wasn ’ t extremely hot, sexy, or even cute, but she was very beautiful. She was the kind of woman I ’ d love to bring home to meet my parents, the kind of woman I ’ d want to marry and have kids with. We met up in a pre-arranged coffee shop. Neither of us talked very much, and when we did, it was short and a bit awkward. We were both very shy. I woke up not long after that, but I remembered the dream vividly. 
 
 The next night I met up with the same woman in the same red dress. It was the exact same dream. Everything happened exactly as it had the previous night, though I didn ’ t realize it in the dream. When I woke up, I thought it was rather bizarre to have the same dream twice, but I didn ’ t think about it much. The same dream occurred for the third night in a row. This time, however, in the dream, I had a peculiar sense of deja vu. 
 
 The fourth time, as I was walking up to the coffee shop, I realized that I had done this before. It was more than a sense of deja vu, though I couldn ’ t quite put my finger on it. I easily predicted the appearance of the woman I was to meet, only, this time, she wore a different dress. She had on a blue, frilly dress with a short skirt and no arms. Mildly surprised at this, I sat down at the table on the other side. The rest of the dream happened just as it had previously occurred. When I woke up, I was confused, and a little frustrated at what my subconscious was trying to tell me. Maybe it was saying I should change my life up a little bit. Maybe it was telling me I was stuck in a rut. I just didn ’ t know. 
 
 Next night, when I closed my eyes to go to sleep, I tried to think of something other than the woman in the coffee shop. I was trying to force my dreams to be something, anything different. It didn ’ t work. When I fell asleep, there I was again, plunged into the same scenario, though I didn ’ t know it. I walked up to the coffee shop and sat down at the table with the woman in her blue dress on the opposite side, only, it wasn ’ t a coffee shop. It was a bakery. Confused, I asked her a question, the first change I ’ d made in the dream myself. 
 
 “ Weren ’ t we supposed to meet at a coffee shop? ” I asked, hesitantly. She looked surprised and looked about her. 
 
 “ I ’ m... not sure, ” she replied. She looked as confused as I felt. “ I thought you were going to wear your tuxedo. ” 
 
 I looked down for the first time at my own clothing. I had honestly never even noticed what I, myself was wearing. It was a simple three piece suit, but definitely not a tuxedo. “ I ’ m... not sure, ” I echoed her words back at her. A moment of silence passed as we stared at each other, in utter confusion. We both laughed at the same time. The rest of the dream passed without incident. I woke up and just laid there for a while. I actually said into the silence, “ Seriously brain, what the fuck are you trying to tell me? ” 
 
 I didn ’ t sleep the next night at all. I didn ’ t want to be anywhere near that woman again. I was sick and tired of it. At work, I dozed lightly in my tiny, one-man cubical. Because I was so tired, it was completely dreamless. 
 
 The next night, I stayed up all night playing video games. I didn ’ t have work in the morning, so I didn ’ t care. Unable to stay awake another second, I resigned myself to my bed at noon. Finally, I had a different dream. I ’ m not sure what it was about, because I couldn ’ t remember it once I woke up, but it definitely wasn ’ t the woman in the dress. I woke up after only a couple hours, and sighed in relief. 
 
 I thought it was just a passing thing. I thought it was over. I wasn ’ t worried about it anymore, so the next night, I went to bed at my normal hour. As soon as I fell asleep, I was dropped back into the dream again. I was inexplicably angry as I marched up to the bakery where I sat down opposite to the woman in her blue dress. 
 
 “ This is a dream, ” she said. My eyes widened in surprise and alarm. At her words, sparks flew through my brain. 
 
 * “ She ’ s right. None of this is real. The deja vu, the odd sensations I ’ ve been having, ” * I thought, very quickly. My mouth dropped open as the neurons in my brain fired in rapid succession. * “ We met at a coffee shop in previous iterations, and she wore a red dress before. ” * Memories of all the previous dreams came flooding back. * “ If I am dreaming, then I ’ m not real. The dream me doesn ’ t exist at all. If this is a dream, then there must be a dreamer. Who is he?... I can ’ t remember. ” * The thoughts of the real me were hidden from the dream me. 
 
 “ What ’ s your name? ” she asked. 
 
 I stared at her for a moment. * “ I ’ m not real. I can be anyone, ” * I thought to myself. “ My name is... ” I tried to think of a cool sounding name, “ Xavier. ” 
 
 “ Xavier, huh? I ’ m Ruby. ” She held out her hand and I shook it politely. “ So, the coffee shop... ” 
 
 * “ So she remembered, ” * I thought. “ Uhh, yeah. And your dress. ” 
 
 “ And your suit, ” she replied, simply. 
 
 “ Yeah, I guess so. ” A moment of silence. 

",Rewrite the prompt as a tragic romance novel,"In the dim glow of the moonlit sky, the scent of coffee lingered in the air, a symphony of dreams and tragedy. Underneath the velvety tapestry of stars, fate intertwined with the destiny of a young soul, weaving a tale of love and loss.

In this cafe, fate orchestrated a meeting, a chance encounter between a dream and reality. The woman, adorned in a crimson dress, exuded an aura of mystery and allure. Her eyes, a vibrant hue of emerald, mirrored the moon's reflection, holding the promise of a future intertwined. But the connection was fleeting, as awkward as a first encounter on a cold winter night.

Night after night, the same dream unfolded, a cruel tapestry of heartbreak and longing. The woman, draped in different hues, danced through her dreams, taunting him with glimpses of what could have been. Yet, there was a bittersweet solace in knowing that the dream was recurring, a testament to the enduring power of fate and the fleeting nature of love.

As the dream faded into reality, the young man was left grappling with emotions, confusion, and frustration. The subconscious whispers secrets, urging him to break free from the confines of his routine, but he remained trapped in the clutches of his recurring dream.

In the twilight hours, as the stars cast long shadows upon the ground, the young man closed his eyes, hoping for a respite from the tormenting dream. But fate had a cruel game to play, pulling him deeper into the abyss of his subconscious. As he drifted into slumber, the same dream unfolded, a testament to the cruel hand of fate and the fleeting nature of dreams.

And so, the tragic romance of the young soul, intertwined with the enigmatic woman in the crimson dress, became a tale etched in the annals of time, a reminder that dreams, like life itself, are fleeting and enigmatic.",zfXxRVkgHq

,"``... And that's how, using only a bottle of ketchup and three pickles, Ms.Dawson over here was able to stage the car accident that covered up the murder of Mr.Riverside.'' My little presentation was finished by a half-bow and a smug smirk, my gestures carefully executed to maximize the dramatic effect. 
 
 I straightened up and crossed my arms. Now was the end of my part, I just had to wait for the rest of the cast to do theirs in order to conclude the piece. For now the aforementionned Ms.Dawson was speechless, as the rest of the room in fact. Her mind was still reeling from my brilliant, if I may say so, demonstration. The poor lady was probably shocked that her `` clever'' scheme was so easily uncovered by myself. 
 
 The silence was starting to stretch on, but this was to be expected. After all some people were quite slow on the uptake and failed to recognize their cue. Being overwhelmed by the power of my mind probably did n't help the matter. But soon, extremely so if the suddenly pensive look on her face was any indication, Ms.Dawson would realize she had just been found out and would simply accept her fate. Or have a break down. But since both lead to a confession and thus an admittance of my genius, it was the same to me, really. 
 
 The silence had blanketed the room longer than I was used to and even the police and onlookers were starting to shuffle qround, waiting for Ms.Dawson's reaction. The latter was still in her thoughts, face frozen in shock and eyes far away. You could almost see the little gears working their magic inside her brain in order for the pin to finally drop. Any time now. 
 
 And indeed, a few split seconds down the road, Ms.Dawson shook out her haze and grinned. She was going to go for the meltdown it seemed. 
 
 `` Well, Detective,'' she said `` while this is certainly an admirable demonstration you just performed and your hypothesis was very compelling, I have the regret to ask: Do you have any proof of what you are claiming? Because if so, maybe you should put it out on the open as I have absolutely no recollection of having committed any crime...'' 
 
 Again the grave silence of revelation fell on the room. The culprit had spoken. Now it was the time for the police to come and- 
 
 Wait, what? 
 
 No, this was wrong. Completely wrong. This was not what she was supposed to say. I kindly informed her of it. 
 
 `` This is the wrong answer Ms. Dawson. You might have no recollection of the fact, though I doubt it, but everyone knows you did it. So make this easier on yourself and start confessing.'' 
 
 `` I am truly sorry detective, but I promise that I have not taken part in any crimes. Your words wo n't sway my stance on this subject.'' 
 
 Her self-satisfied grin had grew, and it was really not a pleasant sight. I was really growing irritated with this nonsense. Not only was she straying off the script but she was trying to belittle my genius. I would have none of that. 
 
 `` Oh come on, you are starting to get ridiculous. Everyone heard my demonstration. It was perfectly logic without any holes in it. You are done. Now confess already and let us finish with this tiring game.'' 
 
 `` Oh my, is the detective losing his cool? I did not mean to offend you in any way, I am just pointing out that your demonstration, while convincing, does not prove anything. Surely this will hold some consideration in the eyes of these fine officers?'' She turned to the confused looking policemen. 
 
 Meanwhile the onlookers were now looking at ME while whispering. Her self-congratulating-and-very-annoying-smug smirk had widened some more and was clearly showing teeth now. The policemen were squibbling among themselves, recognizing the lack of evidence but trusting my perfect record until there. I was losing my audience, and fast. All of this was spiralling out of control and I felt as if I had been caught wrong-footed. My anger grew twicefold. 
 
 `` Ok let me repeat it for you in terms you might understand, Ms. Dawson. Now, you have been found out. You are done, checkmate. So now you wo n't deny anything since it's already over. Instead you are supposed to say:'' 
 
 I took on a high-pitched voice: `` I confess. I did it! I killed him just like you said. But he deserved it! He was mean to me... or some other rubbish I do n't care about.'' 
 
 `` Here!'' I said back in my normal voice `` Is that too complicated for you, Ms. Dawson? Now, say it.'' 
 
 Ms. Dawson had listened to my rant with a clearly amused face, disbelief covering her eyes. It seemed the sentiment was shared by the rest of the room, judging by the incredulous looks I was getting. Her sorry excuse of a worthless-contemptuous-strangling-worthy-smug smirk broket to let out a cristalline chuckle. She was laughing. At me. 
 
 Furious, I turned toward the officer in charge. He offered me a half-shrug in apology while murmuring excuses about needing solid proof for prosecution. I turned away inches away from slapping him. He needed solid proof. Solid proof. As if my demonstration was not evidence enough of her culpability. Incompetent, I tell you. I was just surrounded by incompetent fools unable to even comprehend one word out of ten I pronounced. 
 
 I looked back to the unrepentant culprit that was still laughing. The crowd had started to join her. This was not supposed to happen. Did they not know their place? Could n't we just get back on topic, follow the script and be done with it? Was there really no person of moderate intellect here? I was tired of waiting for those idiots to stop their guffaws. 
 
 Huffing, I took a step toward the source of my stress. Planting my feet firmly into the floor I looked at her with determination and firmly said: 
 
 `` Stop laughing.'' 
 
 She did n't. I took another step forward as my eyes narrowed a little more. 
 
 `` Stop. Now. If you are not going to say anything interesting, shut up.'' 
 
 Still no reaction. Her hilarity seemed too strong for her to understand simple words. 
 
 `` I said stop! Now repeat what I told you to say or be quiet and grovel!'' I yelled 
 
 My choice of words was apparently too elaborate for her emotionnal simpleton mind as my sentence threw her in renewed high-pitched giggles. She was hysterical, I though with disgust. At the end of my patience with her, I took two more steps and towered over her. My intense glare fixated on her face, I said darkly: 
 
 `` Say.It:'I killed Mr. Riverside' Now.'' 
 
 `` SAY IT!'' I screamt 
 
 The silence fell once more with the grace of a hammer. Everyone was staring at me nervously. Not so funny now, eh? 
 
 The officer in charge took a hesitant step toward me. 
 
 `` Scott'' he said `` I will need you to calm down. Step back please'' 
 
 I ignored him. I was too busy glaring with the full strenght of my ire at the despicable Ms.Dawson. She spoke: 
 
 `` Look, I understand that you worked hard to build your deduction. But I am sorry to tell you that you have to keep searching. I did not kill anyone!'' 
 
 Oh, fuck it. I was past the limit now. If she did n't use her breath to do her fucking part, then she had no need for it. 
 
 Quick as a blink I pounced on her. Seizing her with my right hand while my left one was retrieving the gun in my back pocket, I drew out my weapon and fired. A clean shot straight through the skull struck by the full might of my wrath and of my justice-filled genius. Her corpse collapsed as a boneless doll. Boom. Instant death. No one would ever weasel their way out of the script or disrespect the truth I spoke. Not on my watch anyway. 
 
 I was distantly aware of the panicking civilians cries over the ringing in my ears. I also heard the police officers move in my back while shouting orders. I put my hands in the air while letting my gun clatter on the ground. 
 
 Turning, I look right back at the police forces surrounding me and said in my highest-pitched voice: 
 
 `` I confess. I did it! I killed her just like you saw. But she deserved it: she was mean to me!'' 
 
 
 
 Here, that's how you do it.

,"What're some of your methods when you create your characters? I found that I'm more of a visual character creator: when I see a picture of someone, anyone, real or fiction based, I'll see a trait of a character that I'm creating. When I have what I need, that's when I truly begin working on a character for a story. 
 
 For example, 1 of a select few characters that I've spent quite a few years on, I've searched pretty far and wide and in-between to find suitable characters to help compose the character I was making. For instance, if you took FF7's Zack Fair's hair and changed it just right, and give the character a rectangle face and dark blue eyes and a scar that travels along a part of the characters right eye and runs along his forehead, this character is one of my good guys. His name is Marik Darkaito and I'll share a little bit'bout him. He's tall, roughly about 6'4'', 6'5'' and has a somewhat muscled build, one that's more slimmed down and not bulky. Anyways, he's an introvert by nature and it shows in his face. He's also a bit of a loner, not exactly by choice, rather by circumstance and later on he suffers a lot of things. I ca n't go into specifics as I wish not to spoil it for anyone. Anyways, he becomes an unknown hero in a struggle that began as a feud of race, a race of monstrous proportions.

**Step 1: Visual Inspiration**

When you see a picture of someone, real or fiction based, pay attention to the traits that you see. These traits can be used as inspiration for your own character creation.

**Step 2: Gather Materials**

Once you have what you need, such as pictures of people who inspire you, you can begin working on a character for a story.

**Step 3: Character Creation**

Start by visualizing a character that you want to create. Consider their physical appearance, personality, and backstory. Use your imagination to create unique and memorable characters.

**Step 4: Build the Character**

Once you have a general idea of your character, start developing their physical appearance and personality. Take into account their age, gender, race, and any distinguishing features.

**Step 5: Develop the Character's Personality**

Think about your character's personality and what motivates them. What are their goals and aspirations? What are their strengths and weaknesses?

**Step 6: Create a Backstory**

Develop your character's backstory to give them depth and dimension. This can include their childhood experiences, family relationships, and any significant events that have shaped their personality.

**Step 7: Character Journey**

Once you have created your character, start writing their story. Consider their journey, their struggles, and their triumphs.",uVYqxLYObF

,"It was an unseasonably warm day at the start of autumn. Nick and I were sitting on the back veranda of his parents house smoking joints and discussing what to with the day. 
 `` It would be wrong to waste it,'' said nick, exhaling a cloud of smoke, `` I mean if we do n't do something then we'll end up sitting here all day.'' 
 `` Is there anything wrong with that?'' I asked. 
'Not necessarily, but Mum will be home soon and you know how she is. I do n't really feel like playing twenty questions right now.'' 
 `` Yeah, that's a good point actually. I dunno, maybe we could go check out the salt marsh. Ellie was talking about it, said she had like a spiritual experience or some shit. Could be cool.'' 
 `` Yeah fuck it, I guess so. You driving?'' 
 `` Nah, let's take the bikes, man.'' 
 `` Yeah, alright. Hold up though, I want to roll another spliff.'' 
 He passed the joint to me and stood up slowly, stretching his arms and twisting his back. I took another drag, sucking the last, concentrated dregs of dope and flicked the roach over the railing. It flipped over and over in an arc and disappeared into the hedge, never to be seen again, hopefully. 
 While nick was taking care of business inside, I went around the side of the house and collected the bikes. I waited for him out the front then we took to the road, pedaling at a slow and steady rate; soaking in the suburban scenery. Box shaped houses of gray and white and brown lined the sides of the street, divided by brown wooden fences that rose to about head-height. They all looked more or less the same and reflected that if I had n't traveled this street many times I could very easily get disoriented. That got me onto thinking about memory in general, and whether my memories would exist after I died. I entertained the idea for a while and then burst out laughing at the absurdity of it. 
 Stoned musings filled my mind all the way until the end of town; to where the houses dropped away to be replaced by twisting gum trees and scratchy shrubs. We rode for another ten minutes, occasionally commenting on the sensuous shapes of the trees and the soft, rich colours that streaked their trunks. 
 In turn, the trees dropped away and we knew we were approaching the marsh. We rode until we came upon an olive green national park's sign at the foot of a winding gravel path. 
 `` Guess this is it then,' said Nick. 
 `` Yeah, I guess so.'' 
 `` Should we take the bikes?'' 
 `` Nah, leave them here I reckon. It'll be nicer walking.'' 
 We stored the bikes in the bushes, making sure they were hidden from the road, and started on down the path. The path was mostly flat, and coated with little beads of gravel that crunched beneath our shoes. Conversation was limited as we moved languidly along the path; both of us content to listen to the scattered calls of hidden birds. About ten minutes down the path we came across an old metal sign. The sign was supported by a rusted steel column and the face was covered in faded images and barely legible writing. As I stood before it noticed that the bird calls had stopped. In fact, all of the sounds of the woods had stopped, dampened as if by a wet blanket. In their place was a faint psychic drone, but it was n't a sound so much, more of a sensation, something coming from inside my head rather than outside. It swept through my mind, ethereal and ghost-like, a faint singing that sounded like a tortured lullaby. It was there for a few moments and then was gone, replaced again by the hum of insects and the whisper of wind. 
 I turned to look at Nick. `` Did you hear that?'' 
 `` What?'' He cocked one eyebrow at me. `` The birds?'' 
 `` No, that sound!'' 
 `` What sound?'' 
 `` That fucking eerie signing.'' 
 `` I do n't know what you're talking about, man.'' 
 There was a silence that hung between us for a few moments like tangible barrier as I processed what he said. 
 `` Do n't worry about it,'' I said, `` I was just wigging out a bit.''

",Rewrite the superhero origin story as a tragedy,"The sun shone down on the back veranda, casting long shadows across the lawn. Nick and I sat there, smoking joints and contemplating the day. The air was thick with the scent of smoke and anticipation. I felt a sense of dread as I watched him prepare to leave, knowing that this day would forever be etched in my memory.

As the smoke dissipated, I looked at Nick with a mixture of sadness and longing. He was like a river flowing away from me, carrying my hopes and dreams with him. The day was perfect for a journey, but fate had a cruel hand to play.

We rode our bikes down the road, the wind blowing through our hair. The suburban landscape unfolded before us, a symphony of gray and brown. The houses stood tall like tombstones, their emptiness mirroring the emptiness of my soul. As I rode, I was consumed by thoughts of my past and the future that lay ahead. The memories I had treasured for so long seemed to slip through my grasp like grains of sand.

The further I rode, the closer I felt to tragedy. The trees twisted and groaned, their branches reaching out as if to warn me of the fate that awaited me. The wind carried the scent of decay and destruction, a harbinger of the tragedy that lay ahead.

As I reached the end of town, the houses began to fade away, replaced by the towering gum trees that lined the path to my destruction. The wind howled and the sky roared, and I felt a sense of dread as I prepared for the inevitable.",BnvxdnJmEM

,"The dust was everywhere. It hung lazily in the beams of sun which penetrated the decaying concrete building. It coated the ground, gently crunching beneath boot when trod upon. It penetrated every available crevice and orifice. It was even a liability in how it could creep up one ’ s nose threatening to elicit a sneeze. Something so typically benign could be death here. The uniformity of the dusts dispersion was quite impressive if it wasn ’ t so sad. 
 
 
 
 
 The city was once teeming with life. It was a bustling center of commerce. Of life. Of love. All of the best aspects of humanity had the fertile soil here to flourish and take root. Those days were gone now. The less hearty structures now lay in heaps along the sides of the roads. Their massive bulk, once fallen to the ground, was brushed aside so as to not be a hindrance. Now only the most stalwart buildings stood, if you could call it that. 
 
 
 
 
 Arnand found himself crouched in the doorway, his binocular ’ s lenses annoyingly occluded by the omnipresent dust. He quickly untucked his shirt to wipe the lens clean when something caught his eye. Scrambling to replace the binoculars, he focused them down the street through the crack in the wall which hid his lookout. There was movement. Two figures were peeking around a building ’ s edge on the next street corner. They didn ’ t seem to be wearing the fatigues which were typical of the enemy but it wouldn ’ t be the first time they donned civilian clothes to try to lure him out. 
 
 
 
 
 The lookout let the binoculars hang on the string around his neck, as he pulled out his phone. “ Two Spotted. Unknown affiliation. Alberston Street Corner W, ” was all that he texted but it got the point across. After tucking the phone back into his pocket, he turned his attention back down the street. The individuals seem to have come out from cover and were setting something up. With the aid of the binoculars he made out what appeared to be a large video camera. “ Journalists perhaps?, ” he thought to himself. What was weird though was that they appeared to be pointing the camera directly at his location. Arnand quickly scanned the area immediately around him to make sure nothing was sticking out. He shouldn ’ t have been detectable in his current location. They had used it dozens of times for this purpose. 
 
 
 
 
 As he put the lenses back to his face, he saw the blinking red light at the top of the journalists ’ camera. “ Its recording? ” Just as the words formed in his head the wall his left shoulder was leaning against exploded inward knocking him clean off his feet. The disturbance caused a storm of dust to kick up. Sunlight flooded into the room through the gaping hole and backlit a hulking figure. It picked its way over what remained of the wall and grabbed a stunned Arnand by the leg. Just as the lookout started to scramble away from the intruder, like a ragdoll he was thrown through the hole in the wall and out into the street. 
 
 
 
 
 Now in the stark daylight of the noonday sun, Arnand clearly saw his assailant pick his way back out of the building. Covered from head to toe in a black matte material, the form walking toward him was clearly human but somehow more imposing. Not one inch of flesh was visible on the creature. The mask that covered the head gave it a slight alien impression but the very clear human skull artfully depicted grinning at him let him know what lay beneath. 
 
 
 
 Arnand scrambled back from the giant and skittered further into the middle of the street. He looked to the corner where the journalists stood, hoping that their humanity would force them to intervene on his behalf, but all he saw was the blinking red light. The camera blinked indifferently at him taking the whole ordeal in. “ Who are these monsters? ” He changed his attention to down the street, hoping that perhaps his compatriots pre-emptively sent help based on his communique. What he found caused him to stop his scuttle. They were everywhere. Numerous black clad demons emerged from the structures which lined the street. They burrowed through new holes in the sides of concrete structures, no doubt crafted by their own powerful hands. They jumped off three story buildings, landing on the street mid-stride as if they merely walked off a curb. He even saw one or two of them land in the middle of the street, apparently free falling from the heavens. They all walked causally pursuing their prey. 
 
 
 
 
 At the feet of each of these creatures was one or more of his comrades. None were faring any better than him. They all looked like sheep being corralled to the slaughter. He wasn ’ t wrong. A message needed to be sent and it was to be televised on every television on the planet. The game had changed.

The dust in the courtroom was thick and oppressive, clinging to the air and coating the seats. The smell of war permeated the atmosphere, a testament to the atrocities that had occurred. The prosecution presented its case against the defendants, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

The city once known for its vibrancy and life was now a ghost town, its former glory long since faded. The destruction wrought by war had left an indelible mark on the landscape, turning once proud structures into heaps of rubble. All that remained were the remnants of a once thriving civilization, a stark reminder of the devastating power of human folly.

The defendant, Arnand, found himself in the doorway of a crumbling building, his senses overwhelmed by the dust and the silence. As he peered through a crack in the wall, he spotted two figures huddled in the shadows. They wore no insignia of the enemy, but their actions belied their neutrality. With a swift text, the lookout informed his superiors of the suspicious activity, alerting them to the potential danger.

Despite the evidence presented against them, the defendants pleaded not guilty, claiming that they were victims of mistaken identity or misinterpreted signals. However, the prosecution presented irrefutable evidence proving their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury found the defendants guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, delivering justice to the victims and their families.

The dust in the courtroom cleared, leaving behind a sense of relief and closure. The city stood as a testament to the resilience of humanity, and the hope that such horrors would never occur again.",DPreRdUkKG

,"It takes all your poise to keep from joining Larry again in the bathroom. By now the toilet, the bathtub and the kitchen sink reek. His retching echoes through the apartment as you're sitting on the hard lumpy futon with Mop Head, whose own mother calls him that, smoking the strongest pot you've got left to help ease the nausea and the wild headaches. You think it helps but there's no telling. It feels like someone's drilling holes in your head. 
 
 `` Must have been the shawarma we got afterwards,'' he says. 
 
 `` Fuck, do n't even bring it up.'' 
 
 Mop Head takes a huge hit and passes the bong. 
 
 `` So what do we do with the stuff?'' you ask. 
 
 He exhales, closing his eyes. 
 
 `` The payload?'' 
 
 Fuck off, you think, as the water under you gurgles. 
 
 `` Yeah,'' you say, sending a stream of smoke towards the ceiling. 
 
 He cradles the bong back in his crossed lap. 
 
 `` We wait for the right buyer,'' he says. 
 
 `` What are we even selling?'' 
 
 `` Something good,'' he shrugs. 
 
 Larry stumbles into the living room, both hands clamping his head. He sways like you're on a boat. 
 
 `` Feels like something took a shit inside me.'' 
 
 `` I was just saying it must have been the shawarma we got after...'' 
 
 `` Screw the shawarma, man. I said do n't bring it up.'' 
 
 `` It's not the shawarma,'' says Larry, `` It's that fucking thing outside.'' 
 
 He lets go of his head to point through the sheet-thin wall, where the truck currently resides. 
 
 `` We have to get rid of it.'' 
 
 `` We ca n't until we find a buyer.'' 
 
 `` All this shit started when we stole that truck, man. Do n't tell me you want to sit on it any more than I do. There's shit in my sink, man!'' 
 
 `` Correlation, not causation,'' Mop Head says. `` Just because it started around the same time does n't mean it's what caused it. I say it was the shawarma. The chicken was n't cooked properly and we probably have salmonella.'' 
 
 `` Fuck you,'' Larry says for you. `` I've been throwing up blood.'' 
 
 But you ca n't help agree with Mop Head. It's just a crate in a truck. There's something in the crate worth a lot, worth needing guards. You do n't know anything that could cause what's been happening to you and you do n't believe in curses and superstitious shit like that. It's just as likely you got food poisoning. Still something about that crate does n't seem right. 
 
 `` We do n't even know what's in there,'' you say. `` Maybe if we just take a look.'' 
 
 `` Do n't need to,'' says Mop Head. `` Someone'll buy it as is and we'll never have to steal anything ever again.'' 
 
 `` And you're going to find someone to sell it to smoking pot all day in this fucking apartment right?'' Larry says. 
 
 `` You're starting to sound like my last girlfriend.'' 
 
 `` Your last girlfriend was a crack whore. Do n't me tell me shit.'' 
 
 Larry disappears into the bathroom again. Mop Head keeps puffing in peace. How he can sit there meditating like that you have no clue. You click on the TV and flip through to the news. 
 
 `` I do n't watch the news,'' he says. 
 
 As he goes on about how everything you watch is controlled, you do n't ask why he even keeps a television and instead turn up the volume over his BS and Larry's retching. 
 
 `` Wait, they're talking about the thing we stole.'' 
 
 There's a lot of pussyfooting, cycling of clips of armored squads, still-shots of the place you hijacked the truck from, and the reporter finally says what you're waiting for. 
 
 `` Authorities still have no leads on the current location of the radioactive material, but the search continues. Experts have confirmed however that the perpetrators who have stolen the shipment are dying or already dead. If you have any information, please call...'' 
 
 You get to your feet. 
 
 `` Did you hear that?'' you say, `` What the hell have you gotten us into, Mop?'' 
 
 You look over at the man. Some time into his mumbled conspiracy theories, he's fallen asleep. Now his mouth is open like an ashtray. Larry's tossing his guts into porcelain inside. You think distantly about taking the truck to the authorities and getting help but it's too late. 
 
 `` Fuck it,'' you say. 
 
 You grab the keys of the truck and go out. Your hands are shaking on the steering wheel but not out of fear or panic. They've been doing that for hours and now you know why. 
 
 You throw the car in reverse and lean out to use the rear-view. Once you're on the street, you slam the pedal and take off, driving as far into the desert as you can. The world grows lonelier. Your mind starts wandering. You stop a couple times to throw up bloodily on the side of the road. On the third you ca n't catch your breath for a full minute and wake up some time later with your face half-caked with dirt and half-crusted with foamy spit. Squinting into the late afternoon sky, you wipe your mouth on your sleeve and hobble back to the car to resume your endless drive. When you ca n't go on any longer, you pull off the highway and into the rocky dunes. Driving over tufts of weed and around wide ditches, you end up in a secluded spot and park the car. You light a cigarette and sit there, dissolving in the acid of the light, burning up and being hammered by heat and radiation and your own god damned hindsight. But you're beyond caring. You wonder if Larry and Mop Head are dead. 
 
 Assholes, you think, and nod off.

","Rewrite the essay as a comedy , where the crooks are trying to get rid of the dangerous cargo , and no one gets hurt .","It takes all your poise to keep from joining Larry again in the bathroom. By now the toilet, the bathtub and the kitchen sink reek. His retching echoes through the apartment as you're sitting on the hard lumpy futon with Mop Head, whose own mother calls him that, smoking the strongest pot you've got left to help ease the nausea and the wild headaches. You think it helps but there's no telling. It feels like someone's drilling holes in your head. 

Mop Head takes a huge hit and passes the bong. 

""So what do we do with the stuff?"" you ask.

He exhales, closing his eyes. ""The payload?""

""Fuck off, you think, as the water under you gurgles.""

Mop Head cradles the bong back in his crossed lap. ""We wait for the right buyer,"" he says.

""What are we even selling?""

""Something good,"" he shrugs.

Larry stumbles into the living room, both hands clamping his head. He sways like you're on a boat.

""Feels like something took a shit inside me,"" Larry says.

""I was just saying it must have been the shawarma we got after...""

""Screw the shawarma, man. I said do n't bring it up.""

""It's not the shawarma,"" says Larry, ""It's that fucking thing outside.""

He lets go of his head to point through the sheet-thin wall, where the truck currently resides.

""We have to get rid of it,"" Larry says.

""We ca n't until we find a buyer,"" Mop Head says.

""All this shit started when we stole that truck, man. Do n't tell me you want to sit on it any more than I do. There's shit in my sink, man!""

Mop Head takes a large gulp of water. ""Correlation, not causation,"" he says. ""Just because it started around the same time does n't mean it's what caused it. I say it was the shawarma. The chicken was n't cooked properly and we probably have salmonella.""

Larry throws his head back in pain. ""Fuck you,"" Larry says for you. ""I've been throwing up all night.""

Mop Head pats Larry on the back. ""Sorry, bro,"" he says. ""But you're gonna have to deal with it.""

,"`` So let me get this straight,'' Brutus demanded, incredulity lining his face. `` You worship the elemental nature of randomness?'' 
 
 `` No, no, that would be blasphemy.'' His ally replied coolly. `` I worship the avatar of the elemental nature of randomness.'' 
 
 The wizard shoot his head in bafflement. `` So, you're a chaotic paladin who does n't worship good? How is that even possible?'' 
 
 The paladin chuckled. `` It is rather simple. Chaos is predictable in its unpredictableness. Chaos will never behave in a way unlike chaos except when, just like chaos is wont to do, it behaves unlike chaos in a chaotic fashion. Furthermore, what is a blessing if not...'' 
 
 The wizard backed away slowly, his head already starting to thud from the conversation. Accidentally, he backed into Jaxter, who stumbled out of my embrace and hit the ground, cursing. 
 
 `` Motherfucking jackass cocksucking dickweed!'' Jax roared out. 
 
 `` Quieten yourself, oaf.'' Nimba barked. `` Do you forget where we are?'' 
 
 `` SHOVE YA HOLY SWORD UP YA HOLY ASS, BITCH!'' Was the reply. 
 
 I exhaled slowly, working backwards from ten in my head, my raised fingers providing a visual cue of where I was in the count. The party noticed, of course, and fell silent. My fists closed on zero, uneventfully, and they released a relieved sigh. 
 
 `` I wish you were more mute like Siren, instead of someone quite likely to set off sirens.'' Brutus stated flatly, his attempt at wit. 
 
 `` And ya'd be better if ya had a brain to match dat brawn. What, did ya bully beat yer way into the astral plane fer enlightenment?'' 
 
 `` Enlightenment comes from multiple sources.'' Nimba offered. `` In fact, I obtained my own by picking up a coin off the street, and musing on how randomly ordered the world was. See, I needed that coin to...'' 
 
 `` Sez the anti-paladin paladin.'' Jax interrupted with a hiss. `` Listen, we gots a muscle wizard, dis here paladin of chance who don even believe in primal good, anna bard who ca n't even speak, much less sing, owing what to his muteness an' all. Frankly, I'm the only one who knows how to do what he's doin', so trust me when I say shut up. Else dis party here? Wo n't last long.'' 
 
 ``'Sez' the rogue who ca n't stay quiet for two seconds, who hurt his leg on the first trap in this dungeon.'' She replied acridly. 
 
 He looked down at the injured limb, wincing at the reminder. `` Yeah? Wells, I can stay quiet long enough to get behind ya behind and shove a dagger up it, so best -'' 
 
 I raised a hand suddenly, my forked ears perking forward at a sudden noise. 
 
 `` D'ya hear something, merman?'' Nimba asked quietly. I nodded. 
 
 `` He's not a merman, he's a siren. I mean, it's his fuckin' name as well, all like his parents ran outta gooduns and were jes like'lez call dis here siren Siren, hyuck hyuck,' but anyways... there's a bunch of cultural differences, ya dumb fuck, plus dem ears what be like a snake, if snakes had ears. Honestly, does nobody else here pay attention in diplomacy class?'' 
 
 I coughed to recover their attention, the only limited noise I could make. Quickly, I drew in the dirt below us a rough outline of where the enemies were coming from, as well as a few suggestions on how best to handle them. Belatedly, I remembered that Jax was the only one present who could read. 
 
 `` Yeah, yeah, dats pretty good. I'mma do my usual thing though. Goon one and goon two, what Siren da siren here wants ya to do is...'' 
 
 Time passed as we moved into position, waiting patiently. Finally, the hunting party of trolls rounded the corner. I quickly counted to confirm what my hearing indicated - twenty five. The largest one holding back, clearly the leader. We'd have to proceed with utmost caution in order to - 
 
 `` YAAAAAAH EAT DAGGA YA DUMB FUCKS!'' Jax screamed suddenly, breaking from his cover to charge forward towards the leader. I slapped my forehead, wishing intensely that I could curse out loud. 
 
 I glanced over at the other two, to make sure they were n't going to improv as well. Brutus stood far to the back, his eyes squinted in concentration, staring at his hand intently. Briefly, I saw the tiniest flicker of flame, struggling to come into being with only his limited intelligence as fuel. 
 
 Standing to the side of him, her eyes casting about calmly for the nearest threat, Nimba held her sword extended. A faint green glow radiated from her, evidence that her holy powers were active. 
 
 I strummed a few notes on my lute, quickly adapting my Melody of Thought into a Dirge of Depression, likewise changing my target from our slow wizard to the trolls. He'd have to get that fire going himself, while I helped make sure Jax did n't die in mere seconds. 
 
 Alas, my efforts were in vain, and I witnessed the rogue splatter underneath a club swung with startling lack of effort. The troll holding it looked down at the smear, bemused at how quickly that ended. A few quick grunts sounded from him, met with reply from the others. It sounded suspiciously like trollish laughter. 
 
 `` You're used to adventurers who send their strongest guy in first, right?'' Brutus grunted towards them conversationally, sweat straining from his brow. `` Unfortunately, our strongest guy is a bit busy here. Aha!'' 
 
 I glanced towards him again, noting that he held in his hand a sputtering flame. 
 
 `` Okay, I'm ready now. Come at me!'' Brutus bellowed out! The trolls, though not speaking our language, obliged. 
 
 `` You going to throw that soon?'' Nimba asked calmly as the enemy charged in. `` I mean, any closer, and we'll get caught in that fireball's blast.'' 
 
 `` Throw it?'' Brutus asked, confused. `` Why would I do that?'' 
 
 Her unshakable composure was finally shook, as she watched him close a fist around the fireball and realized what he intended to do. `` Aww, Goddamn it...'' she muttered, diving to the side. 
 
 `` Fireball!'' Brutus declared, as his flaming fist slammed into the first troll. After a brief pause, there was a muted whump, followed by a vivid flash of light and heat. `` Brutus version!'' He amended, standing over the charred remains of the troll, smoke tendrils whiffing out from his clenched hand. `` It kinda hurts, but why else would I train my body up this much, right?'' 
 
 `` Right...'' Nimba grumbled, standing back up again. `` That's one down, twenty three more to go, plus the big guy in the back. How many times can you do that in a row?'' 
 
 `` Uh... just once. Siren was supposed to boost my brain a bit, but he got distracted by Jax dying. Such a shame. Oh well. I still have a few Acid Bolts in hand, pun not intended.'' 
 
 `` And what after that, pray tell?'' 
 
 `` I guess I just beat the shit out of'em until they stop getting back up.'' 
 
 `` Sounds better than my plan, at least.'' 
 
 `` Oh? What's your plan?'' 
 
 `` Sit here and pray something goes right for us.'' 
 
 The battle continued to rage for the next five minutes. To the combined credit of both the paladin and the wizard, they were able to take down another ten trollish underlings, but slowly, they continued to wear out, while the merely injured trolls just recovered quickly from any damage they took. 
 
 I began to step forward, accepting that I'd have to participate more actively in the fight, when Nimba yelled out suddenly. 
 
 `` Keep playing the lute, fool! You're about to ruin my setup!'' 
 
 I hastily resumed strumming, wondering what she had planned. The nine trolls backing her into a corner picked up their stalk as well, confident that she was about to die. I was n't so unsure on that, myself. 
 
 A low rumble entered the chamber, rapidly growing louder. Scant seconds later, the ceiling caved in, crushing the seven. Moments after that, a crashing was heard overhead, and unbelievably, liquid fire began pouring out through the newly formed hole, incinerating the trolls. Nimba calmly stepped over the blaze, stopping next to the wizard. 
 
 `` Okay.'' Brutus said into the stunned silence. `` Who the hell did that, and how the hell did they do that?'' 
 
 `` Simple.'' Nimba stated smugly. `` I simply invoked my powers over chance. I mean, what are the odds that there would be a chamber overhead, structurally weakened by the vibrations of the lute being played, which would *furthermore* be where these trolls keep their vials of eternal flame, despite trolls having no logical use for or need to keep fire, their greatest weakness, around? It's absolutely preposterous and chaotic... right?'' 
 
 `` Right...'' 
 
 `` Next time, you might want to listen to my story about the coin I found, that led to me being a paladin. It's a good story.'' 
 
 `` Right...'' 
 
 The remaining trolls, numbering now only five, stared at us nervously. 
 
 `` Of course, now that I've invoked my daily miracle, I'm tapped out. Anyone else got any bright ideas?'' 
 
 I stepped forward again, tentatively. `` What, you want to take on the final five yourself?'' I nodded, and concentrated. 
 
 `` Oh... hey... I recognize this.'' Brutus said slowly, his eyes shut in determined thought. `` We had a guy at the academy... was n't cut out to be a wizard, but his power flowed through the same channels... what was his name... and what was his... oooh.'' 
 
 His eyes snapped open in shock. `` You're a...?'' 
 
 **INDEED. ** 
 
 The voice boomed through the room, splattering two of the trolls with sheer percussive force. 
 
 `` A ventriloquist?'' Nimba asked, an eyebrow raised. 
 
 `` No, Siren's a...'' 
 
 **PSION. AND MY NAME IS PSIREN. THE P IS SILENT, JUST LIKE ME. ** 
 
 Two other trolls exploded. I noted cooly that the other two were almost fully reformed, the blessing and curse of their troll blood. 
 
 I decided to put an end to that, hefting my lute into a slightly different position. Channeling all of my mind into it as amplification, I strummed the string once. 
 
 `` Fuck...'' 
 
 `` What'd you say?'' 
 
 I smirked. Accelerating the soundwaves to the point that they heated up was difficult, but the four burnt remains before me were the reward. A little deafness was a fair trade. I turned to the last one, the boss. 
 
 Just in time to hear a shlick, and witness his head pop off, steaming from the acid on Jax's dagger. 
 
 `` What? You did n't think y'all were the only special folk here, right? My illusion died, not me.''

The wizard backed away slowly, his head already starting to thud from the conversation. Accidentally, he backed into Jaxter, who stumbled out of his embrace and hit the ground, but he wasn't swearing this time.

""Oh no!"" Jaxter exclaimed, his voice dripping. ""Did I bump into you, my dear Nimba?""

Nimba rushed to his side, her heart filled with compassion. ""Fear not, my dear Jaxter. I have got you.""

They embraced, and despite the wizard's initial apprehension, the atmosphere was filled with joy and happiness.

,"It was roughly 2 years ago that the nukes went off, coating the entire planet in radiation. The only ones that survived were those in bunkers on the ground, and us in that were in the air at the time, high enough to fly above the radiation. Drones kept us going, delivering fuel every now and then to keep us up, as well as food and water in heavy, lead lined cases. 
 
 We got word that the radiation was rising. Before long, it would reach our maximum altitude, and our cells would slowly mutate to death. We got word that some kind of high-altitude aircraft would dock with us and transfer everyone on board, while our plane would be landed back down on the surface. 
 
 Well, it came, and guess who had to be sitting on the john? You guessed it! No one even remembered my existence. I'm guessing they all just wanted more room for themselves, but oh well. There's not much that can be done now. I can see them every now and then, flying overhead.

,"I sent the others to look through the halls. Try to find survivors. Find out what happened here that killed this city. We were sent here after all evidence of citizens quickly disappeared. They stopped sending soldiers against us and their workers ceased harvesting our resources. 
 
 The dead clutter the halls that are not destroyed by this area's shaking. Whatever happened here happened fast. No emergency procedures were enacted, no emergency tunnels used, and no children evacuated. I sent one scout back to homeland as we arrived to report this atrocity, and to make sure no one else comes into this territory should we not make it out alive. 
 
 `` Sir! I believe I found what caused this.'' 
 
 One of my squad has reported back. I follow him and his scent trail to a chamber. `` Observe. I have found what remains of their record room. In it, they describe something they've been encountering in this territory. They believed it to be The Great Destroyer, and I am inclined to agree with them.'' 
 
 `` You think that the thing that obliterated The Original Hive is not only real, but here?!?.....We need to get out of here.'' 
 
 Another member of my squad comes up behind me, following our trails. `` Sir! I found a message in the lowest tunnels. The message said that this city was killed by some sort of non-breathable air. They were the last ones killed by it, but were trapped down there.'' 
 
 I ordered us to retreat and we moved to the surface. The ones left in the tunnel could follow us when they find our trails and messages. We will tell the colony to never traverse this area. We are not trained to deal with Mythical Beasts.

As the dust settles, a lone survivor emerges from the wreckage, burdened by the weight of memories and a grim responsibility.

The halls are eerily quiet, their emptiness echoing through the broken walls. The dead litter the corridors, their decaying bodies serving as grim reminders of the tragedy that unfolded. No emergency procedures were enacted, leaving behind an unsettling testament to the suddenness and ruthlessness of the events that unfolded.

Suddenly, a glimmer of hope emerges from the darkness as a squad member approaches the surviving leader, his voice trembling with urgency. ""Sir, I believe I found what caused this,"" he proclaims. Following his scent trail, the leader arrives at a chamber, his heart pounding with anticipation. The remnants of a record room reveal a chilling account of encounters with a mythical beast known as The Great Destroyer. The belief that the destructive force was real and present in this territory is met with a surge of dread.

As the leader's suspicions are confirmed, a message from the lowest tunnels surfaces, revealing the final fate of the city. Trapped in suffocating air, the inhabitants were the last victims of this monstrous air, their voices silenced forever. With a grim determination, the leader orders his squad to retreat, leaving the dead behind.

Their escape is not without its challenges. The ones left in the tunnels can follow their trails and messages, posing a threat to their safety.

Some people have been making assumptions about me based on my previous prayers and comments. They're saying that I'm greedy and selfish, and that I'm not grateful for the blessings I have. I understand that people can have their own interpretations of my words, but I'm not trying to be controversial or hurtful. I'm simply expressing my feelings and my desire for a more just and equitable world.

I know that the world is a complex and messy place, and that there is a lot of suffering. I'm not blind to the challenges that people face, and I'm not pretending to have all the answers. But I do believe that we can all work together to create a better world, one where everyone has access to food, water, and basic necessities.

I'm also aware that some people may not be able to understand my perspective. That's okay. I'm not trying to convince anyone to believe in anything. I'm just sharing my own thoughts and feelings, and I hope that they can be a source of inspiration for others.

Thank you for listening, God. I know that you're always there, and I appreciate your compassion. Amen.''",ovplIGNCeP

It was looking into the fog of a familiar place. The throbbing sensation in my head turned into a throbbing pain, then I realized my entire body was sore and in pain. I look around trying to find any sign of light in the dark confined space I was thrown into. I rustle into a more comfortable position and I hear a rustle from the room beyond. Someone was here. My blood runs fast and my heart trembles. 
 
 The door opens and behold stands a man that my mind had not expected at all. Here stands a well dressed man, in a black striped dress suit, blue tie, and a noticeable blue watch on his right hand. He extends his left hand to me. I stupidly I expected to be gently lifted up but instead he throws me upwards and pushes me towards a chair. I stumbled onto the chair, almost being thrown over the chair. I recover and took my respective seat. I was not in a very welcoming place. 
 
 “ Get up. ” a very stern voice poked out from behind me. The room itself was very well illuminated and yet I didn ’ t even seem him there nor heard him move. Am I still dazed? My thoughts ran wild as my anxiety flared up. I ’ m now on the ground and the entire room is ringing. My mind recovers and I stand up straight. The force of the unforeseen slap knocked me clear on the ground. I look into the eyes of the man that stood once behind me. This man was strange. Contrary to the well dressed man this man was very sloppily dressed. He had blue grey jeans that had grease stains all over, a black leather belt, and a light red shirt with a tear on the right shoulder. This was a man that did not give a fuck about his appearance. 
 
 “ Mr. Green. I ’ ve been very anxious to see you. ” my blood rate pumped up at the mere sentence, “ You ’ ve been noticed. I don ’ t see what ’ s so special about you, but apparently you are exactly that. Special. ” 
 
 I was confused. Have I done anything wrong? A horrifying thought appeared at the back of my mind. Could this be the Mafia that killed my family? I am the last living member of my family after my Father, God rest his soul, had a gambling addiction that went too far. My entire family was gunned down by them. I sputtered the only word my mind could think, “ What? ”. He seemed to be annoyed by this, but he continued. 
 
 “ I ’ ll cut it short Green. My daughter has taken notice of you. She spoke to me about your skills in driving. You ’ re quite the sport. ” He took a deep breath, “ I ’ ll make it simple Green. I don ’ t like you. I may look like I could be one of your buddies, but I hate you and everything you group of shitheads do. However I love my daughter, and I ’ m not going to let my opinions get in the way. I made an agreement with my daughter that she can have you if I first give you a taste of what will happen if you cross her. ” 
 
 I heard a doorknob turn and in walked an extremely attractive woman. Our eyes locked. I could feel the back of my eyes burn and water start to form in the front. I knew now that the situation wasn ’ t a petty crush. I looked into the eyes of my Sister.

There is a key piece of evidence that suggests the investigation was set up internally. First, the well-dressed man, whose appearance screamed wealth and authority, suddenly changes his demeanor and becomes aggressive when the victim stands up. Second, the victim states that the voice like that of a demon screams from behind him. This suggests that the perpetrator was deliberately trying to create an atmosphere of fear and terror. Third, the victim states that he was not in a very welcoming place. This suggests that the perpetrator was trying to create a sense of entrapment and helplessness. Fourth, the perpetrator uses the victim's name in an aggressive tone, and also states that he has been ""very anxious to see"" the victim. This suggests that the perpetrator was trying to establish a connection with the victim and make him feel like he was being watched.",gTaXqOXJDQ

 My first invention was a Freezewave- a microwave that made food cold instead of hot near instantly. But when I brought the design to the patent clerk, she pointed to a design submitted two days before.

That invention had earned millions- millions I could have spent upon new inventions, but instead went to Zinbeil, who eagerly accepted the stolen money.

,"`` Finally, what's going on Darkness? I need a status update.'' Nightshade said. 
 
 `` Everything is on schedule for the bank job, but I must say these code names are really stupid.'' Darkness replied. 
 
 `` You enjoy spending my money and you'll enjoy how rich this job will make you, so you'll tolerate my foolish eccentricities or you'll be back begging in back alleys like you were when I found you.'' Nightshade snapped back. 
 
 There was silence on the other end for a while. `` I'll call you back in two hours when we're finally ready to deploy. Take care Nightshade.'' he practically spat the name Nightshade as he said it before hanging up. 
 
 Nightshade sat at his desk and frowned. He'd been so magnanimous in his offer to these people, all dead end criminals with nothing going on, he'd given them a chance at riches and a life beyond what they could dream of, yet almost all of them seemed petty and pathetic, they did n't like their code names, or their uniforms, or just about anything he asked of them. 
 
 `` Siren, am I overbearing?'' Nightshade asked of his personal assistant. 
 
 Siren was a slightly overweight twenty something man who had been unfortunately forced into a sexy secretary outfit. He stumbled about in his four inch red heels while his matching mini-skirt fought with his belly before giving up and sinking down to expose the black thong underwear he'd been required to wear. His suit top exposed his flabby belly along with lots of chest hair in the middle of his cleavage of his padded bra. 
 
 `` No sir, not at all.'' Siren reassured Nightshade. 
 
 `` Good, thank you Siren, that's awful reassuring.'' Nightshade replied. His sexy personal assistant had never failed him, it had been three years since he'd inherited his family's money, everyone had said he was a stupid fool who would squander their legacy, but he'd show them, Timmy Martello was going to become the criminal mastermind of the east coast, the dreaded Nightshade. 
 
 The police sirens startled Nightshade, there was no way they could be on to him, everything had been planned so perfectly, so secretly. There was no way it could all come crashing down even before his first great caper. 
 
 `` Come out Martello. We have the building surrounded. Your crew gave you up. Just come out and nobody gets hurt.'' a voice bellowed through a bullhorn. 
 
 `` Siren. Did you betray me?'' Nightshade asked nervously. 
 
 `` No sir.'' Siren said, turning his face away from Nightshade. `` We're caught sir, it's over.'' he told his boss. 
 
 `` Oh no it's not. I still have the mass deflector shield! Those fools will never know what hit them.'' Nightshade shouted as he opened a drawer in his desk and began fumbling around for his device. `` There it is. Eat electric death pigs!'' he shouted in triumph as he hit the switch. 
 
 `` This is Rebecca Han for KTZ Channel 6 news standing near the smoldering ruins of what used to be an abandoned fish packaging plant in the downtown area. Police say that the wealthy heir Timmy Martello had converted the plant into a'supervillain lair' and had rigged the plant with explosives to prevent his capture. At this moment we have not found the body of Mr. Martello or any of his associates.'' 
 
 `` One of the men who turned Martello into the police who asked only to be identified as Darkness said and I quote'this sounds like something that moron would do.' We will keep you up to date with any news coming from the scene. This is Rebecca Han for Channel 6 news.''

""This...this can't be what I think it is, can it?'' he whispered through the comm, a stark contrast to the buzzing that resonated through the cave, a melody of suspense resonating alongside his voice.

I looked upon the lifeless bodies of the three soldiers, their skin marred by grotesque growths and a sight that sent shivers down my spine. A Soviet flag, small and limp, flapped on the cave floor, a symbol of oppression amidst the morbid scene. There was a stark connection between the bodies; a spectral umbilical cord, invisible to the naked eye, bound them to one another.

The scent of her tears filled my senses and I couldn't help but wonder if she had been crying for the years she had been away or for the pain she had endured. I knew that she had been hurting because she had lost a lot of people who were important to her and it had made her very angry. I hated seeing her in that state and I felt a need to do something to make her feel better.

,"`` It does n't feel right, being out of uniform like this.'' 
 
 I was crouched down, placing the last explosive charge on a painstakingly selected support beam. I had the rest of the goons decked out in civilian clothing instead of the blatantly sinister looking red and black commando gear everyone sees from a fucking mile away. 
 
 Winston was the most troubled by all this. I had been tuning him out for the past few hours but he would n't stop pressing the matter. 
 
 `` Come on Hiddy. This is n't what we're about. We're supervillains and you have us doing this generic terrorist shit.'' 
 
 I'd had enough of this, so I finally spoke up. 
 
 `` Look,'' I stood and faced Winston, along with the other six men I had chosen to leave the base with me, `` If you want to go back to being used as fodder for some super-powered model in tights to kick to shit out of then I'll kill you right now. It'd probably be more humane than whatever that'hero' would do to you anyhow.'' 
 
 Winston's stoney expression softened a bit. He was one of the favored of Deathsinger's henchmen. Even had his own villain name, Soprano, and a distinct uniform which was even more impractical and clunky than Deathsinger's own militant opera singer get up. He was, like so many of the morons who went into supervillainary, a gifted criminal more interested in theatrics than practicality. 
 
 There was no further need to explain. I walked towards the door and the other goons stepped aside and followed after me. 
 
 There would be no telltale signs of Deathsinger being involved in this crime. No epic battle with any heroes. A simple terrorist attack which would sift the political balance and open doors. We'd be long gone by the time the charges went off. 
 
 I had n't fully figured out how the full transition of power would playout yet. Slipping the ricin into Deathsinger's wine was a last ditch attempt to save myself from the superhero beating I was probably slated for when the evil lord's most idiotic, hero-baiting plot ever predictably fell apart.

Taking care not to wake his wife, he got out of bed to put some wood in the kiln for another long day of pottery making. He gazed out at the pale orange dawn over Hyrule and reflected about how much had changed since the invasion. 
 
 Sure, the royal family had been slaughtered mercilessly, but the Gerudo had also driven out those wretched other creatures from the land. Now that the Gorons were gone, great mining projects had begun in Death Mountain, turning Hyrule into a centre of industry and trade. Great factories had been built to refine the coal and iron from the mines, allowing for the construction of powerful machines and more bountiful harvests. The Kokiri were driven from the forests, allowing a booming lumber and construction industry to rise. With the Zora having fled following the death of Jabu-Jabu, the rivers had been diverted to aqueducts and irrigation, allowing for such bountiful harvests that Mollu's two daughters had never known hunger in their lives.

 `` Sir, those are automatic doors, and saying the words knock knock instead of knocking is ineffective.'' The pale face contorted in what I sincerely hoped was meant to be a grin. His bones cracked and dead skin fell off in huge layers as he staggered in, dragging his right leg. Grimacing, I grabbed the intercom speaker. `` Clean-up in aisle-I mean- entrance.'' 
 
 `` He-llo, I came here for...'' He uttered a grating wail before continuing, `` Flesh apples...'' I sighed. `` Sir, we have no flesh apples. Only fresh apples.'' 
 
 He paused and squinted at me. One of his eyeballs slid out and rolled away. 
 This did nothing to stop his suspicious glare. 
 
 I sighed even deeper. `` Fresh apples were mistyped to be flesh apples. Our fresh apples are fresh and make up for any undead suffering withdrawal from flesh.'' I held up an apple as if to prove it was not a product of flesh.

,"`` They killed them.'' 
 
 Camilla rubbed the back of her neck where her collar chafed. `` Legally, Ruuf...'' 
 
 The alien slammed a grey tentacle into the table hard enough to leave suckermarks on the glass top. `` *Fuck* legally! Those Pales enslaved us and then they kill us. They just keep doing it. Again and again.'' 
 
 This was just another night on the *Magna Carta*, the terribly named ship that functioned as a law firm whenever a disaster happened on one world or another. Many of the industrial colonies had no need for anything other than a contract office and a Justice in good times; it was cheaper for the lawyers to be mobile. 
 
 `` And then they make us clean up our own dead,'' noted Jackson from the corner, sipping at his scotch with one hand and running the other through his grey hair. Only the slight blue tint of his skin under the florescent lights hinted that he was n't fully human. 
 
 Ruuf wanted to knock the mountain of paperwork off the table. But they'd been working all night. Working to defend the corporation whose actions had led to the death of another three people. Miners this time. Last case it had been roughnecks drilling for the gas the Pales only called Dust. And the case before that had been a civilian shuttle crash. 
 
 Each time the *Magna Carta* set course, it was always towards death. Workplace accidents. Negligence, usually. Sometimes it was rebellions, although they were not a criminally focused ship. 
 
 `` I'm done. I ca n't do this any more.'' Ruuf felt dry. Like he had n't touched water in years. 
 
 `` You signed a contract.'' Camilla was always the detached one, even though she was the youngest and newest. She had cut her teeth articling in criminal courts and it seemed to have quickly desensitized her. It had made her accustomed to death, at least, and the things that death was preferable to. 
 
 `` My great-great-grandparents signed a contract! Putting me in the position where I thought... I do n't know, that they'd treat their housepets better than their field animals!'' 
 
 Jackson snorted. `` Dumb thing to think.'' 
 
 Camilla rose, striding to the bar to pour herself a glass of vodka. Her hands were steady despite the old scars on them. `` You know you ca n't really leave.'' 
 
 `` Manual labour is better than this. It's honest.'' 
 
 `` You believe that? Mining their resources? Cleaning their buildings? That does n't serve their purpose any more than this does? Just because you do n't have to think about it?'' 
 
 He slumped into the chair. He could not stop staring at his tentacle. The thing that set him so apart from everything else in this office. He was the only Aquen besides one of the females who worked at the lunch counter. 
 
 He was tired of feeling dry. He was tired of everyone laughing at the way he spoke and acted. He was tired of seven years of expensive school never making up for the fact that he had been raised on a traditional rural planet and he would never walk or talk or think like them. 
 
 He wanted his family. He wanted the ocean. 
 
 `` I... I just want to go home.'' 
 
 The human female drank deeply. `` The Pales made that planet for you. Not for free. You have a debt to pay off.'' 
 
 `` I fucking *know*. You're human, you can survive anywhere. What do you know about debt?'' 
 
 Camilla set her glass down and with her prim and proper motions unbutoned her shirt despite Jackson's initial protests. She wore a camisole underneath, of course, but as she shed the dress blouse her full neck was visible hidden only by the metal collar. 
 
 Her tattoo extended past her collar bone. The average Aquren had two lines, the species debt indicator and whatever the individual had taken on. Most humans had a thick record, of course, but not like this. 
 
 `` Tabernac,'' swore Jackson. `` I did n't know...'' 
 
 `` That I was born on Earth? It's not something one likes to admit to, is it?'' Just as primly she put the shirt back on, but did not re-tuck or button it. `` We were the last ones off. I was five. At that point they could charge whatever they liked for a ticket, and you could either pay it... or burn.'' 
 
 Ruuf tried to swallow his pity and regain his indignation. `` Many chose to burn.'' 
 
 `` Most of my family did. My father did not. My sister was under his debt, but the Pale age of contract consent is five. My first lesson in contract law.'' She took another deep drink. `` I... I'm from the ocean, too. So you know. Before... Before it boiled.'' 
 
 `` Tabernac, Wilson, are you fucking crying?'' 
 
 The young woman whipped her head away from the partial human, but now Ruuf could see the single drop of moisture cutting through her pale makeup. 
 
 Ruuf took a tissue from the desk and extended a tentacle towards her. 
 
 Camilla took it without acknowledgement, dabbed away the lone traitor, and then crumbled it and tossed it into the waste disintegration unit. She then finished her drink in a single swig without a trace of a grimace. 
 
 `` Leave, Ruuf. If you ca n't do this case, leave. Sweep floors. Drill Dust. Pretend you're less of a slave than those of us closer to the end of the leash. Just get the fuck out of my sight.'' 
 
 `` Fuck you. Fuck you and your saline tears. We are helping to deprive slaves of their debt clearance so we can clear a portion of our own. We're holding the whips for them.'' 
 
 `` You heard me. They built you a nice little water park, go home to it. And it is home for you. You were born there. And Jackson, your grandmother was a Siine, the Pales even saved your planet. But the Capital is the only home I get. My monthly payments are the only constant in my life. And I have no choice.'' 
 
 Ruuf rose. He snatched the empty glass from her hand and shattered it against the wall. Both corporation property. 
 
 `` You could have burnt. We should have burnt.'' 
 
 Jackson, ever the orator, sighed from the corner. `` You ca n't fight them. You never can.'' 
 
 `` Why? Because their paper contracts put steel collars on us? Because they do n't expect one of the hundreds of races they bought and sold to ever resist?'' 
 
 Camilla was already back at the bar. `` Because contracts and debt are their religion. And we're their offerings. Burnt or otherwise. They'll charge you thirty credits for that glass. If not more.'' 
 
 This was too much for him. He left. He had no idea what he would do or how he would survive, let alone rid himself of his tattoos of debt or his collar, but he knew he was no longer a lawyer. He was no longer a Citizen of the Pale Corporation. And he could no longer live without the waves. 
 
 As the tentacled being stormed out of the office, Camilla only arched an eyebrow. Part of her wished she could follow him. The other part reminded her that the first layer of her tattoo, a strip no larger than an old screen's pixel, would be removed at the end of the month. 
 
 It would make her collar no lighter. It would make her conscience no cleaner. It would not unboil her ocean. But it was a start.

,"At first they said it was a hoax. The news hit so many different websites, all telling the same story and citing the same sources. A whistleblower, a scientist who was part of the AIP ( Afterlife Investigation Program ), who could n't stand keeping the world in the dark when nothing mattered anymore. So he blabbed to everyone, told them that Hell has not only been proven to exist, but that we all go there when we die. The details were scarce, so it was pretty easy for all of the nations' leaders to denounce the claim as a terrible lie from a deeply-disturbed individual. People forgot about it for a while. 
 
 Only for a while. Another scientist, also a member of the AIP, followed the first, and reiterated what the first scientist had said. This time he brought proof. Videos of the experiments they did. There was a lot I did n't understand when I listened to the scientists speak about their experiments, but it was enough to worry people. All over the world, riots erupted, people marched to their government and demanded the truth. All it took was the breaking of one president, and then the truth was out. 
 
 No-one could've imagine the chaos that ensued, it was like the apocalypse, the actual end of days. There was so much looting and kidnapping and murder, so much senseless violence now that people felt that life was even more meaningless than previously thought. The police and the military were n't enough to hold back the anger and fear of the nations, and eventually they gave up, bit by bit, until people were left to their animalistic rage. 
 
 Then came the suicides. That was surprising, and I found it completely absurd how many people had decided to hurry to their eternal torture in Hell rather than try to put it off. But I understand them now. Most of us go through life expecting the afterlife to be better; even if you do n't believe in Heaven, nothingness must be some sort of relief. And then the bombshell came, and we learnt that life was as good as it gets. That this temporary, fleeting rollercoaster is counting down, minute by minute, to the moment we face an eternity of unimaginable suffering. No relief. 
 
 Besides, life is n't life anymore. There is no society, no laws, no jobs, no sense of purpose or enjoyment. People try to be happy, sure. They try to make the most of life before the end comes. But it's hard, especially when there's so much violence and death surrounding us, and everything we used to define as part of living is gone. We're all just animals now. 
 
 Every day, there's brain matter and bits of bone and skin and blood caking the concrete, or cars driving into walls or off bridges. Not as much as there was in the beginning, but every day, it happens. 
 
 Then you get the people who were rich before this happened. They've put their money to good use. They manage to get the healthiest food possible, exercise daily with a perfect workout schedule, and have their own doctors and surgeons living with them, just in case. While the rest of us scavenge or steal, or make do with the rations we're given by our faint attempt at a remaining government. There are others even worse off. They've been known to hold doctors hostage, or their spouse or children, forcing them to check them out or operate or prescribe medication. 
 
 But there are people even lower than that. People who do n't care, or do n't think about what it means, to be burning in Hell for eternity. They take pleasure in causing the pain of others, and the chaos excites them. This is their Heaven. Or maybe this is just Purgatory. Maybe Hell is truly where they belong. 
 
 We're all capable of anything. People always said humans had a strong survival instinct, and that was back when we thought we'd be going to Heaven.

,"It was a pretty normal day for me. I was running around my house trying not to be late. It helps that i know where everything in my apartment was. I had just enough time to grab my bag and my keys, maybe lock my front door if i remember it on the way out. Keys are one the table by the front door. I have to remember that. I check my pockets to make sure i have everything else i need; phone, wallet, and now the keys. A quick step out the front door rewards me with a little bit of pain in my toe as something rattles across the floor into the opposite wall. 
 
 
 `` Fuck. What was that?'' I glance down and notice for the first time a jar. A jar with a dollar in it. The word swear is written on a white sheet of paper practical laminated onto the jar with packing tape. I dont really give it much extra thought as i turn to lock my front door. Must have been one of the neighbors that heard me getting made at one of my games last night. 
 `` Fuck'em if they ca n't take a litle extra noise'' with the door fully locked i turn back around and give the jar a second look to see if the writing on the side matched one of my neighbor's writing. The writing is neat almost printed, though quite clearly written with maybe a sharpie or something. The writting almost matches the font of the two dollars that are in the jar. Weird it has n't moved since i kicked it so a new prospective of the contents is a little too difficult to explain. I glance up and down the hall to see if anyone might be watching. 
 
 
 `` This is fucking stupid. Why a swear jar and not a note to keep it down or something?'' I'm mostly mumbling to myself as i glance around. The jar is trash and should be thrown away. Im an asshole, but not a scumbag. I bend over and pick up the jar. With a little shake i notice my count must have been off. There are three bills. All ones. I counted them right the first time, im positive. I cram my hand in the jar and pull out the three bills and stuff them into my pocket. 
 `` This is a stupid fucking prank, but at least i get a shitty soda out of it.'' I dont know why i keep mumbling to myself out loud. `` Dumbass assholes.'' I start walking the jar down stair to the trash can waiting on the first floor. I walk down the two flights of stairs, my morning rush kind of numbed thanks to the weird jar on my door step. I approach the trash can as i go to leave and i give the jar one last look as it starts to fly into the can. More dollars. The jar hits with a solid thump as i reach my hand into my pocket. Three dollars. I emptied the jar up stairs. It was empty last i looked. My morning plays in my head. It has to be a coincidence that the dollars are equal to how much i cursed this morning. I meant if you count dumbass. I pause for what felt like a moments. I think through everything. Theres only one way to figure this out i guess. 
 
 
 `` Shit. Fuck. Fuck. Shit. Ass. Fuck. Fuck. Motherfuck. Cucksucker.'' I let a string of obscenities fly out of my mouth. Caution to the wind. 
 
 
 `` Shit! Fuck! I forgot to count. Fuck I'm an idiot. Fuck! Start counting! Whats it been like 20?'' I take a deep breath to calm myself. And i finally peak into the trash can. Nestled snugly on top of crumpled papers and bags and someones old lo mein rests a jar with more than a hand full of bills in it. 
 
 
 With a quick look around i roll up one of my sleeves. `` This is fucking stupid, but there's no way im passing up a jar like this bullshit if I'm not fucking crazy right now. I should have bought wet naps or something because the dickhead who put that lo mein in there dirtied my fucking jar.'' A slow stream of curses leave my mouth as i reach for the jar.

",Rewrite the story as a futuristic science fiction thriller,"In the dystopian future of the year 2077, the city streets were shrouded in an ominous silence. The oppressive atmosphere was thick with the scent of decay and desperation. I raced through my sleek, futuristic apartment, my mind on autopilot, my senses on high alert. The clock glowed red, mocking my lateness. I knew precisely where everything in my tiny abode was, like the intricate map of a battlefield. My fingers raced across my cluttered desk, grabbing my backpack and keys, my thoughts drifting to locking my front door. But as I reached for my keys, my heart froze, my blood turning to ice.

They were there, the keys, but they were not in their usual place. They sat on the table by the front door, taunting me, as if mocking my vulnerability. My mind raced, searching for answers. I checked my pockets, my heart pounding with dread, hoping to find a hidden message or a sinister trap. But all I found was the cold, unforgiving silence of my apartment.

Suddenly, a jarring sound echoed through the hallway, sending shivers down my spine. It was the unmistakable sound of a jar being rattled across the floor, followed by a muttered swear. My blood ran cold as I turned around, my senses on high alert. There, on the floor, was a rectangular glass container, its contents glistening with greed. The word ""Fuck"" was scrawled on a sheet of paper, laminated onto the jar with an eerie precision.

I stared at the jar, my mind reeling from disbelief and terror. The writing was neat, almost printed, as if done by a skilled hand. It matched the font of the two dollars that rested comfortably in the jar. My stomach churned with nausea and dread. The thought of someone watching me, knowing I was vulnerable, sent shivers down my spine. I glanced up and down the hallway, my heart pounding in my chest. The coast was clear, and I took a deep breath, attempting to calm my nerves.

I bent over and retrieved the jar, its contents taunting me. With a shake of my hand, I counted the bills. There were three, all ones. I had counted them right the first time, I was certain. I crammed my hand into the jar, retrieved the bills, and stuffed them into my pocket. As I straightened up, a wave of relief washed over me. The danger had passed, and I was safe.",hTEvUdEoNZ

 “ What ’ s that? ” He had a deep voice and towered over the both of us. She picks the oddest people to settle bets. 
 
 “ Can you wink? Can you close only one eye? ” She squinted her eyes down to slits, as if to show him something she couldn ’ t do. 
 
 “ You can ’ t just close just one eye, they close together. ” He seemed very sure of himself so I winked at him.

",Rewrite the story focusing just on the main character 's high school,"In my high school, there were a few moments that stood out from the rest. One such moment happened during a movie night out with friends. It was a night filled with laughter, excitement, and a shared sense of camaraderie. As the credits rolled, I found myself in an unexpected conversation with a girl, her eyes sparkling with mischief. She challenged me to engage in a playful exchange, one that involved the enigmatic art of winking.

I had always been curious about the ability to wink, and this girl, with her boundless energy and boundless imagination, presented me with the perfect opportunity to explore this mystery. Her words, ""It's like you blinked but only one eye closed,"" painted a vivid picture in my mind. I felt as if I was in a dream, where reality and fantasy intertwined.

As I teased her, she reciprocated with her own playful jabs, making me smile. But she soon revealed her secret - she couldn't wink. It was a moment of revelation, a shared vulnerability, and a recognition of the uniqueness that each person brings to the world.

I tried to explain to her that winking was a natural ability, like breathing or blinking. But she was adamant, insisting that it was a supernatural gift. As I began to doubt my own memory, she suggested we ask a stranger in line to demonstrate the art of winking.

With a mischievous grin, I winked at the unsuspecting individual, hoping to prove to her that I was not a magician but simply a skilled flirt. To my surprise, the stranger revealed that winking was a natural phenomenon that occurred when both eyes closed together. It was a moment of shared understanding, a recognition that the boundaries of reality could be defied, and that anything was possible.

My high school memories are filled with moments like this one, moments that shaped me and taught me valuable lessons.

**Safety and Shelter:**

* **Seek refuge at night:** The quiet halls of a hospital offer a sense of peace and solitude, mimicking the natural rhythm of the night. Consider using a hospital room if possible, even if you need to pay a fee.
* **Make the night your ally:** Take advantage of the quiet to rest and conserve energy. Sleep is vital for physical and mental recovery, even amidst a desolate landscape.

**Mind and Body:**

* **Manage pain and anxiety:** Following a traumatic event like a brain aneurysm, coping with pain and anxiety is paramount. Medication and therapy can help address these difficulties.
* **Find comfort in routine:** The routine of a hospital, with its consistent schedule and calming medical equipment, can provide a sense of order amidst the chaos. Embrace the rhythm of the night and the methodical nature of medical procedures.

They sat on the floor of Sixtysecondius' lair, their elbows propped on their knees, their backs against opposite walls. Their faces were lit by the flickering torches that lined the dark stone walls. 
 
 `` You have n't tried anything in a while,'' the villain said wearily. `` Why? Planning some new strategy?'' 
 
 The hero chuckled weakly. `` No. What's to plan? I may be able to look forward to see whether my plan of attack will work or not, but when I'm on the verge of beating you, you just send us back. I mean, I may not be aware of us being sent back, but from the way this... this'fight' has gone so far, I can guess at what's been happening.'' 
 
 Sixtysecondius could n't help a half-smile. `` You do n't know the half of it. For me, this is like the short-film version of'Groundhog Day'. I've lost count of how many times we've had this conversation.'' 
 
 `` Oh, do I try something a minute from now?''

 `` So we're making progress.'' 
 
 The villain laughed. `` I suppose.'' There was another long moment of silence. `` What did you do back before you were famous? How did you first use your powers?'' 
 
 Minute Man was silent for a moment. `` Well, I did n't do what I tell everyone I did. I've always said that I foresaw a little girl being hit by a car, and rushed out into the intersection just in time to save her. And I did, but that's not how I discovered my powers. For a long time before that, I... I was a pickpocket.'' 
 
 `` What? Are you serious?'' Sixtysecondius was grinning. 
 
 `` Yep. It was so easy. I would reach for someone's wallet, and just look forward. I could see whether or not I'd been caught in the act, and if I saw it was all-clear, I would go ahead. It did n't just work for pickpocketing either. All kinds of stuff. Reaching over counters to grab money from cash registers, shoplifting, I did anything I could think of.'' 
 
 `` You know, I started out pretty much the same. Of course, I just had to go ahead with it, and if it went sour, I would just rewind. But the same principle.'' Sixtysecondius shook his head. `` I may have been a petty thief, but it's amazing how fast I built up money when I could do it fearlessly, all the time, one after another. That's how I built up my fortune.''

With a wave of his hand, he cordially invited a woman into his presence, initiating a sequence of events that would culminate in a tragic conclusion.

The guest's entrance was met with a smile, and her body was meticulously scanned. With a grin that stretched across his face, he expressed his delight at her arrival, uttering the familiar phrase, ""I'm glad you're here."" The woman reciprocated his sentiment with a giddily grinning smile and offered a beverage. As the intoxication deepened, they drank together, their laughter echoing through the night.

Following a prolonged drinking session, the protagonist led the woman back to his private quarters, where he initiated a sexual encounter. As she removed her shirt, he sat back with a drink, his attention focused on the intricate details of her anatomy. With a combination of finger and thumb, he expertly removed her pants, revealing her breast implants. The woman's nakedness afforded him an opportunity for admiration, and he seized the moment, gripping at the base of his horn.

A surge of passion consumed the encounter, and the climax was reached. The protagonist's satisfaction, however, was overshadowed by the tragic end that awaited his victim. As she leapt to her feet, a knife slipped from her hand and pierced his chest, ultimately ending his life.

 I looked up from my desk and stared at the wall. There was red button encased in a plastic cover, labeled `` Emergency Stop''. It was the hundredth time I've looked up at it today. *What the hell does that button do? * 
 
 `` Seriously, Laurie,'' I started. `` What does that button stop?'' 
 
 Laurie looked up from her desk, which was opposite mine. Several other desks were paired together all around the room, with people typing away on computers, some talking to each other. 
 
 `` *Oh my god*,'' she said. `` Leave it *alone* already. Who cares?'' 
 
 `` I care. It's driving me crazy.'' I stood up and walked over the button. `` It says'Emergency Stop', but there's no machinery.'' 
 
 `` Maybe it's leftover from a previous company that had machinery in here?'' Laurie was looking over in my direction. `` You're not thinking of pressing it, are you?'' 
 
 `` I do n't know. I think I have to or I'll never be able to focus.'' I lifted the plastic case and positioned my finger over the red button. 
 
 `` Do n't,'' Laurie panicked, suddenly up from her desk and standing behind me. It was too late, nothing was going to stop me then. I pushed the button. 
 
 The room became deathly silent. There was no more typing. No more talking. I looked back at Laurie and found a blank stare. 
 
 `` Laurie?'' I asked, but there was no response. I looked around the room and everyone else had the same blank stares. And then, almost all at once, everybody fell to the ground.

 `` Laurie!'' I yelled, dropping to the ground beside my fallen coworker. She did n't seem to be breathing. I jumped back up and ran back to my desk, knocking off my keyboard as I grabbed the phone receiver. As I began to dial 911, the door to the office swung open. A burly man sporting a massive beard was standing there with a tool belt wrapped around his waist. 
 
 `` What the hell happened in here?'' He exclaimed. `` They lose control? Try taking over the world?'' 
 
 `` What?'' I asked, dumbfounded by his questioning. `` Everyone passed out! Who are you? Do you know CPR? My friend Laurie is n't breathing! For all I know, none of them are!'' 
 
 `` I'm Carlson Jones, Tech Support.'' Carlson strolled into the room, surveying the area as he made his way in my direction. 
 
 `` Tech Support! We need paramedics! I'm calling 911.'' I reached back to the phone and started dialing. After hearing the initial ring, the line went dead. Carlson had reached me and hung up the call. 
 
 `` I would n't do that. They do n't respond well to frivolous calls. Do n't worry, I'll have them up and running in no time.'' Carlson walked over to Laurie and pulled her up, dropping her in her chair. He put his finger in her ear. 
 
 `` Wuh,'' I said, thoroughly confused by the events taking place before me. 
 
 Laurie's head clicked as Carlson removed his finger. Her face opened up, revealing a robotic face underneath. He pushed a button in her forehead, or where her forehead would be, and all the circuitry blinked and buzzed, whirring to life. He closed her face and walked over to the next person and repeated the process. 
 
 I looked back at Laurie. Her eyes were cycling between moving back and forth and up and down. They abruptly stopped and then returned to normal. 
 
 `` Good morning.'' She said, now looking like her old self. She wheeled her chair back to her desk and started working. 
 
 `` What are you?'' I asked her. 
 
 `` A *girl*.'' She answered. `` What are you?'' 
 
 I looked over at Carlson who was working on another `` person.'' 
 
 `` What are they?'' I asked him. `` Robots?'' 
 
 `` Who're robots?'' Laurie asked. 
 
 `` Do n't say the'r' word around them.'' Carlson interjected. `` You do n't want to confuse them. Say, what are you even doing here? I thought this whole floor was automated.'' 
 
 `` I work here.'' 
 
 `` They got a human writing online reviews now? What's the point? Better to let the'r's handle that garbage.'' 
 
 I walked over to Carlson intently. Whispering as loud as I could, I spouted, `` What the hell is going on here? I had no idea I was working with a bunch of robots. Start giving me some answers!'' 
 
 Carlson looked closely at my face. 
 
 `` Well, I'll be damned,'' he said. He reached his finger into my ear and I pushed him back. 
 
 `` What the hell are you doing?!'' I shouted. I started running toward the door when a familiar silence returned to the room. I looked back and saw Carlson at the emergency button. Everyone else fell to the ground again. I turned around and ran out of the building.

A daredevil, a coward, and a pampered princess. Michael did not like the odds of their survival. 
 
 Tom ’ s question still hung in the air. Someone shifted uncomfortably. Michael wiped his brow again and spoke up. 
 
 “ Our best option is probably to continue wandering, but we need to somehow mark where we ’ ve been. We ’ re bound to eventually find a way out as long as we stay close and only use one flashlight at a time. ” 
 
 “ Assuming we don ’ t die of thirst or fall down a pit, ” Stacy muttered. 
 
 Tom turned his flashlight on for a moment and then back off. 
 
 “ There ’ s still about three-quarters left in the bottle. ” 
 
 Only Tom had brought a water bottle. The rest of them had only brought their flashlights. When they realized they were lost, Tom offered to share his water. Michael estimated that happened about ten minutes ago, but none of them had any way of telling the time. 
 
 “ Alright, we ’ ll use my flashlight first. Tom, you hold on to the bottle. Let ’ s drink as little as possible. ” 
 
 Michael turned on his flashlight and got to his feet. He spotted a rock the size of his fist on the cave floor and picked it up. He used it to draw a line on the wall and found that it left a whitish chalk-like marking. 
 
 “ Andrew, take this and mark the wall on our right every five feet or so, ” Michael said, tossing his friend the rock. 
 
 For a while, things went pretty well. Whenever there was more than one way to go, Michael led the group to the right, and they seemed to be slowly heading up toward the surface. At one point, they discovered that going right led them in a big circle thanks to the markings on the wall, so they went left instead. 
 
 It was not too long after this discovery that Tom suddenly cried out. Michael whirled around and shined the flashlight in Tom ’ s frightened face. 
 
 “ I heard something. ” His voice was barely a whisper. 
 
 Michael pointed the flashlight in the direction Tom was staring. He saw nothing but rock. 
 
 “ If you make a sound like that again I ’ ll castrate you, ” Stacy hissed. One brief look at her face told Michael she was just as frightened as Tom. 
 
 “ Let ’ s keep moving, ” Andrew said. 
 
 Their progress slowed. At some point, Michael ’ s flashlight became so dim it was difficult to see so Stacy took the lead, and it seemed like every few steps she was turning around and checking to see if anything was following them in the dark. Andrew tried to start a conversation, but it died quickly. 
 
 Suddenly, Stacy stopped and Michael nearly ran into her. 
 
 “ What are you— ” 
 
 “ I need a drink. ” 
 
 Tom wordlessly passed her the bottle. Stacy took a large swallow and handed it back. They were about to resume their journey into the unknown when a shuffling sound froze them all in place. Stacy spun to face the sound and, for just a moment, they caught a glimpse of it. 
 
 It was vaguely human in shape, although it was definitely taller than the average human. Its eyes reflected light in a way that was almost blinding, but the rest of its body was black and shadowy. Michael had never truly understood evil until he looked into the thing ’ s eyes. Its gaze seemed to reach out, grab him, and suffocate him. Stacy ’ s flashlight illuminated it just long enough for them to watch it take a slow step toward them, and then the batteries died. 
 
 Michael turned on his flashlight, brushed past his screaming companions, and ran like a madman. The flashlight was incredibly dim, but it did not matter. All that mattered was getting away from… whatever that thing was. Michael considered himself a knowledgeable guy and had thought his plan foolproof, but he had not accounted for monsters or demons or ghosts. He was skeptical when it came to the supernatural, that is, until he looked into those eyes. At some point, he stopped running, exhausted. A few moments later, to Michael ’ s surprise, Andrew and Stacy appeared, guided by Andrew ’ s flashlight. 
 
 “ Where ’ s Tom? ” 
 
 Andrew and Stacy glanced at each other. Andrew shined his light back toward where they had come from, then shook his head slowly. Michael sighed and sat down. 
 
 They were back to square one, but this time with one less water bottle and one less coward.
",Rewrite the story as the sequel to a beloved children's movie,"The sun shone down on Michael's back as he leaned against the rock wall of the cave. A sense of dread hung in the air, and he knew that this was all Andrew's fault. The darkness enveloped him, and he could not see Andrew's face but he imagined him twisting his mouth like he was eating something sour.

“ I realize that Stacy, that's why I'm trying to think of a way out of this mess. ” Andrew's voice was sullen.

“ I'm telling you there *isn't* a way out of this. We're completely lost and we'll probably die in here. ” Stacy's voice was sharp and cold.

The air was hot and oppressive. Michael wiped the sweat from his brow. There was no need to be so pessimistic, he thought. Tom had brought a water bottle and they still had a quarter left. He imagined his three companions in the places he had last seen them before they turned off the flashlights to conserve the batteries. He imagined his good friend Andrew who had convinced the four of them to explore the cave standing with his wiry arms crossed. He imagined Tom sitting on the ground with his knees pulled up close to his face. He imagined Stacy sitting next to her boyfriend ( how Tom and Stacy ever got in a relationship was beyond Michael's understanding ), sprawled out in a position that could best be described as casual. A daredevil, a coward, and a pampered princess. Michael did not like the odds of their survival.

Suddenly, a sound echoed through the cave, and everyone froze. The air was thick with anticipation. Michael's heart raced, and he felt his blood turn to ice. It was the sound of a dripping rock or the sound of something else entirely. He strained his ears to hear the sound again, but it was gone.

The sound made everyone jump. They looked around, their eyes wide with fear. The cave was silent again. Michael took a deep breath and spoke up.

“ Our best option is probably to continue wandering, but we need to somehow mark where we've been. We're bound to eventually find a way out as long as we stay close and only use one flashlight at a time. ”

Only Tom had brought a water bottle, and they still had a quarter left. They drank their water, shared their fears, and continued to wander through the cave.

They traveled for what felt like hours, but they finally found a way out. They emerged into the sunlight, and they ran to the nearest town. They were exhausted, but they were alive. They had survived the cave and the dangers that lay within its depths.",svLwqXfMex
,"( Alright, so this is a little EU in that as soon as I saw Priest and Monk, my mind zoomed right to D & D, which I reference with class and deity names in here. So, it ’ s a little different, but I suppose here is A Monk, a Cleric and a Rabbi Walk into a Tavern... ) 
 
 Shun was the first to come stumbling into the bar with all the grace and agility that one would expect of a Drunken Master. Whenever Shun comes in my bar, I know that there's going to be some fun tonight, but I might be closed for a few days for repair. 
 
 The next to arrive was Alexander, a newcomer to town but he'd already been ruffling some feathers. I heard he was a cleric, Pelor I think. He immediately started eavesdropping on customers and trying to talk to everyone, get some kind of information out of them. He was n't very good at it. 
 
 Finally, Avrum, another Cleric, came in with his Golem. Yeah, a Golem. Listen, I tried to talk to him about that kind of thing before, but when this colossal rock guy came in here with this massive obsidian construct, I had to rethink my `` No Constructs'' policy at the threat of a living mountain moving right to where my bar was located, so, this thing had become more common than you might think, my bar being the only one in town that served constructs at the time. 
 
 Now, all the players are in place and I'm looking over this crowd and I just know something's about to happen. First thing is I'm serving Shun and Alex comes over to ask him about the local happenings. Shun, well he'd come in three sheets to the wind and I'd been serving him drinks steadily since just after he came in, probably around the time Avrum came across my threshold. All I can figure is he had the wisdom to know trouble was coming. Shun pulls out a personal flask, something I only allow from him, and took a swig of it before ducking as the Golem's arm swung across the bar and sent Alex flying into the opposite wall. 
 
 I'm not saying Avrum meant for him to do that, I mean the thing is just big and for all I know could have been telling a big fish story. But now Alex is embedded in my pantry that suddenly has a new door, Shun is twirling back around to retaliate and Avrum is spitting wine out all over my table. Shun's leg comes up and around and sticks in the Golem's back, the Golem feeling threatened reaches back and grabs him, but he is really stuck in there so as he tugs to try to get him out of his back, here comes Alex, charging in with this big warhammer. 
 
 I have never seen so much clay. The funny thing is some people said it made the ale taste better. Avrum at this point is jumping up and trying to get his Golem under control as Shun looks like he's about to puke as he's being pulled in every different direction as the Golem is spinning around and trying to find Alex, who's trying to match the Golem's movements to stay behind him. 
 
 I swear, this next bit went down in just six second. Avrum is preparing something to simply turn the Golem off, Shun breaks free and knocks Avrum out cold, the Golem bats Shun out the front door and Alex brings the hammer down once more while the golem is distracted, splattering him across everywhere. 
 
 I breathed a sigh of relief that the whole thing was finally done with leaned back up against the wall, which apparently was one thing too many. The entire bar creaked and caved in. I, um, where was I going with that? Oh, yeah, I guess that all it boils down to is, do NOT open a bar that caters to adventurers. It's way more trouble than it's worth.
",Rewrite the story as a dark comedy with absurd and over the top consequences,"Shun, a drunken master of questionable agility, was the first to grace the bar with his presence. With the grace of a drunken ballet dancer, he stumbled in, leaving a trail of his potent libations. Whenever Shun comes to my bar, I know there's going to be some mischief, but I'm also bracing myself for a hefty fine and a lengthy closure.

Next to arrive was Alexander, a novice cleric with a penchant for eavesdropping and a voice like nails on a chalkboard. He immediately began peppering customers with intrusive questions, attempting to glean some information from their lips. His efforts were as futile as a goat herding a herd of drunken elephants.

Finally, Avrum, a mighty Cleric with a golem as formidable as a volcanic eruption, stormed into the tavern. With a single swing of his monstrous arm, he sent a menacing construct flying across the bar, inadvertently sending Alexander on a whirlwind journey into the opposite wall. The scene was chaotic, like a scene from a particularly deranged Shakespearean play.

As I surveyed the aftermath of the carnage, I couldn't help but marvel at the absurdity of the situation. The bar was a mess, the air was thick with the scent of destruction, and the sound of laughter echoed through the tavern. I'm not saying Avrum meant for that to happen, but the gods were certainly smiling upon him that night.",CqnjtZzOhC

**Anya:** Sure, there are those situations where women get pregnant when they're not married and guys who find out their partner has been unfaithful and leave the child to fend for itself. It's a tragedy, but it's not murder. Nature takes its course and eventually the baby won't survive.

**Ben:** I disagree. When a person chooses to leave a newborn out in the woods or some other dangerous place, it's a deliberate act of abandonment and cruelty. It's not nature's fault that the child dies. It's human greed and selfishness.

**Anya:** But if you're so concerned about the child's safety, why don't you focus on the bigger issue of teenage pregnancy and the lack of support systems available to young mothers? It's a complex issue, and we need to address the root causes rather than stigmatize those who find themselves in difficult situations.

,"On a hot day, not a cloud in sight, we saw a flash of lightning. 
 My sister and I ran from the backyard to the front door. 
 Laughing. 
 Not afraid. Surprised. 
 
 This was humid hot. American South hot. The `` I could n't have been a slave, this is ridiculous'' hot. 
 
 It was on those summer days, after being shooed outside because grandma could n't her the TV over `` that racket,'' that we'd spin in circles until we could no longer stand then fall, careful to avoid anthills, and feel the earth spin. 
 
 `` Just water vapor,'' my youngest cousin would say smartly when we assigned forms to the clouds. She'd identify the type of cloud and predict if rain would fall. 
 
 But I never saw reality. The rolling whites lined with majestic grey and somber blue stirred an ineffable feeling deep within me. 
 
 The feeling of reading the names on the spines of a bookshelf. Or when my father explained that every song ever was a combination of twelve tones then taught me their names. 
 
 It made me feel as though life was really big, or maybe deep, but connected.

",Rewrite the essay as a technical description or mechanical diagram using engineering or design language,"The humid, hot air saturated with moisture, reminiscent of the American South, enveloped the surroundings on that scorching day. The sky, devoid of clouds, displayed a lightning flash, igniting an adrenaline surge within the two young siblings. Their laughter echoed through the front door, unfazed by the unexpected spectacle.

The humid air, saturated with moisture, held a palpable electric charge. The lightning flash illuminated the sky, casting long shadows upon the ground. The force of the wind carried the scent of burning earth and distant rain.

The playful spin of the youngsters, as they danced in the scorching heat, was a testament to their boundless energy and resilience. The earth beneath their feet spun in concert with the stars above, creating a sense of profound connection to the natural world.

As the young cousin identified the forms of the clouds and predicted the imminent rain, their words painted a vivid picture in the sky. The rolling whites, adorned with majestic grey and somber blue, stirred an ineffable feeling deep within the hearts of all.

The feeling of reading the names on the spines of a bookshelf, or the profound understanding imparted by a father's teachings, evoked a sense of awe and connection to the vastness of life. It was as if the universe unfolded its secrets, revealing the intricate patterns that intertwined each individual with the cosmos.

Years later, on a languid day, the young girl's laughter resonated through the field, as she cuddled beneath the sky. The presence of the two siblings, enveloped in the embrace of the celestial tapestry, mirrored the feeling of unity and contentment that permeated the air.

Each one is delivered perfectly in my mother ’ s exquisitely dismissive tone, a tone that served me nothing but insult after insult for my entire life as far back as I could remember. It's the final straw. I feel the rage against my mother boiling up one last time. The genie might be right that I'm stupid, but that wo n't stop me.

 I take about a hundred photos. Dude was n't pounding a rando. It was worse. His wife will agree. This is the worst site I've ever seen, and baby, I've dropped acid before sitting through a 8 hour conference on the ethics of being a PI. 
 
 The man stood there. Wearing JNCO's, had a bandana wrapped around his head, with faux dreadlocks, a hatchet man hockey jersey, and the base of white make up. He's like 45. 
 
 `` Bro.'' I say with absolute disgust. 
 
 `` Please do n't tell my wife. I promised her I got out of this life. She'll leave me.'' 
 
 `` I do n't blame her man, look at yourself,'' there is a huge bottle of cherry Faygo on the table. `` You make me sick!'' 
 
 I begin to leave, getting my phone out to call his wife. 
 
 `` Wait! I'll do anything!'' 
 
 `` Go fly a kite kemosabe, this dick finishes the job.'' 
 
 `` I'll give you $ 5000!'' 
 
 `` So what we need to do is call a hooker, get her up here, you do the nasty with her, and I'll send the photos to your wife,'' I suggest. `` Sound good?'' 
 
 `` No that does n't sound good!'' He yells. 
 
 `` Then what the fuck else are we gon na do?'' 
 
 `` Call the hooker,'' he says defeated. 
 
 I dial one of the ladies of the night I know well. Not professionally. I'm a PI, I am practically drowning in trim. She used to work at the liquor store where I used to bounce checks for cheap Rye. 
 
 `` Sassy Tits? Yeah it's your boy, I got a real loser here that need to flop around in ya? You know?'' 
 
 I hang up the phone. 
 
 `` She's on her way,'' I say, `` and she costs another $ 5000.'' 
 
 The man sighs. 
 
 `` And change your fuckin' clothes, you look like an asshole.'' 
 
 My original mark and the hooker did the nasty all right. Some downright Devious shit. Had to hold back a few barfs, but it was all good. Took some prime photos and texted them to his wife. 
 
 Guy told me later when he found me getting hammered at the Olive Garden that his wife was super steamed about the explicit photos and that I did n't need to include so many. He's now getting divorced and said he's going to take on the ICP look full time. To avoid making anymore conversation with this guy I excused myself to the restroom to take a viciously Juicy steamer at the Olive Garden. It's ok, because at Olive Garden, we're family!

I take a long haul off my cigarette, smoke burning my throat. ""Will you be discreet?"" a young housewife asks. ""You bet your god damn ass I will,"" I say, slamming a shot of Maker's Mark. My reputation is on the line, and I ain't afraid to get my hands dirty.

As I get up from the kitchen table, flicking my smoke aimlessly, I hear the housewife's voice, ""Hey! This is my house."" I don't respond. I've got a hundred zingers locked and loaded, but I know the best thing is to save the mouthing off until after the check clears. Once I get mine, I'll tell it like it is, and baby, it's bad to the bone.

Look at this idiot, I say to myself, as I stay 2 cars behind a Ford Flex driven by my mark. How does this guy driving a Ford Flex possibly get to bang 2 different chicks? It's a piece of shit. He makes a 34-point parking job, and I see him get out, dressed in slacks and a dress shirt. I'm thinking, those slacks are a smart look. Sophisticated, but not too pompous. Betting those slacks pulled in the strange he's plowing his wiener into.

I pull out a fresh cigarette and light it off of my already burning cigarette. I've got my camera on, ready to capture this clown's every move. It's a powerful tool, this spying camera. It's got a lens on it the size of a 4-year-old. Huge. Salesman said I could get a picture of the moon with this bad boy. He had taken a few photos of his bare bum and saved it to my memory card before boxing it up. Real strange.

 Jim thought asteroid mining would be more exciting than this. Instead he was stuck in his pod, guiding Haulers across his sector of asteroid 2273 DG. This particular asteroid is supposed to yield tons of iron and cobalt and the operation was well on its way. Jim ’ s supervisor, Aaron Davies, wasn ’ t a bad sort, Jim just didn ’ t like how arrogant he sounded. 
 
 “ I ’ m the super Jim, just keep hauling and you ’ ll get your pay mehmehmeh.. ” Jim mockingly imitated their last exchange, pinching his nose to replicate the super ’ s squeaky voice. 
 
 The immaculately white Haulers kept swarming the drilling points like an army of metal worker ants. They scooped up all of the material that either floated up, or was still on the surface of the asteroid, using their own army of small Seekers. Think small automatically propelled silvery grabbers. The operator then would guide the full Hauler back to the loading docks surrounding the asteroid where they would dump the contents of the Hauler and guide it back to the drilling point. The operators themselves were in their own red pods, constantly in motion to keep up with the asteroid ’ s minor rotation. The supervisors, in their yellow pods, systematically zipped up and down those lines checking for half-filled Haulers or otherwise slacking miner personnel. 
 
 The cherry red release button beckoned Jim, blinking its backlight as if it was trying to say “ hit me and you can go back to the barracks, play another round of low-grav Ping-Pong ”. 
 
 Aaron ’ s pod had just started to make his way back from one of the docks when the scenery suddenly changed, and with it Jim ’ s attitude. The distant star was lighting up the edge of the asteroid, highlighting the army of Haulers and casting elongated shadows of the docks surrounding 2273 DG. The dust the drillers cast up created the illusion of a misty sunset, all in a comforting hue of crimson. 
 
 It was beautiful. 
 
 So beautiful in fact that Jim completely missed his mark to conspire against his supervisor and lost the desire to fight the tedium of mining. This was why he joined the mining expedition. He adjusted his NASA cap and successfully guided his Hauler into the loading dock.

As he stared at the blinking release button, a tantalizing melody echoed through his mind - the promise of a celestial ballet that would warp the very fabric of time.

The asteroid presented a canvas of possibilities, its surface glistening like molten gold under the celestial tapestry. As the Haulers swarmed like metallic locusts, scooping up the mineral treasures, Jim watched the timeless dance of creation and destruction. The Seekers, nimble creatures propelled by an unspoken force, danced alongside the Haulers, their silver grabbers effortlessly capturing the bounty of the asteroid.

With each passing moment, the asteroid's rotation spun a tale of celestial secrets, revealing hidden treasures and ethereal beauty. The stars danced in an enchanting symphony, casting long shadows upon the docks that encircled the asteroid. The dust that danced freely created an illusion of a misty sunset, bathing the asteroid in a comforting aura.

As Jim's pod raced towards the release button, time seemed to slow down, allowing him to savor the breathtaking sights and sounds that unfolded before his eyes. The scenery changed in an instant, revealing a world twisted by the forces of time. The distant star cast its glow upon the asteroid, illuminating the army of Haulers and casting elongated shadows of the docks.

If you stayed out of their way you were fine, but attempt to stop them and you were toast. Literally. The halls smelled like burning hair in some places. They were clearly here for the President.

Mr. Jones sat on his lawn, staring at the ash,
A vow to keep his friend's lawn a lush lush dash.
With the power in his hand, he'd sworn to make it true,
But fate had twisted the story, the price too high, too false.

The aliens came, a force to destroy,
With burning hair and weapons of lore.
They poured across the land, a deadly tide,
And the President's duty was shattered wide.

A trifle to some, but a sacrifice,
A man of honor, willing to fight the fight,
The love of his friend and country's pride,
But fate had sealed the tragedy that day and night.

,"I run out the door of the lottery office with the paper in hand. Cold sweat covers my brow as I dive into the truck and my partner takes off. We're going to be rich. On this paper are the winning numbers to a $ 350 million dollar powerball. All it took was years of planning the heist. We could use these numbers the day of the drawing and win. No one would know of our plan. We left no trace, painstaking attention made sure of that. Tommorow we would both be kings. I could n't stop laughing. No more was Connor Batilla the loser. I was no longer the poor kid in school, or in more recent years, the dude who could n't quit his dead end, back breaking job because of his desperation for money. Tonight will be the last night I go to bed hungry. We had created a certainty that we would have the winning numbers. Jack and I had overcome all odds. Every bitter fool who said we'd never escape poverty would soon be proven wrong. The feeling of triumph was immeasurable. 
 
 As we park the truck in a safe location. Jack looks to me with a euphoric gleam in his eye. 
 
 `` Well, lets see what fateful numbers will change our lives. I ca n't go another minute without knowing.'' I slowly take the paper out of my pocket. It's folded up. with a small motion, the ticket out of hell will be before my eyes. The greatest moment of my previously miserable life has come. I will never forget these numbers. I flick open the paper and my eyes immidetiately scan the fresh ink on the paper. 
 
 Neither Jack or I can read a single fucking thing. 
 
 
 I really do hate my life. 
 

",Rewrite the essay as a mystery: who is responsible for the mass illiteracy and why did they do it?,"In a mysterious town, where whispers of fortune danced through the streets, a tale unfolds. A paper held the promise of riches, but fate took a cruel turn, leaving a mark on the lives of two unsuspecting individuals. The perpetrator of this mass illiteracy, known only as the Shadow Master, was a cunning mind bent on destroying the dreams of others.

The Shadow Master was a master of manipulation, meticulously plotting and executing a scheme that would forever alter the course of history. With meticulous attention to detail, he forged a path that led him to the lottery office, where fate awaited him. As he grasped the paper, a surge of anticipation filled his heart. With swiftness, he ripped the ticket from its envelope, revealing the numbers that would alter his destiny.

However, fate took a cruel turn as the Shadow Master discovered that the paper was riddled with errors, rendered illegible due to his haste and greed. It was as if his triumph had been stolen from him, leaving him with a bitter taste of despair.

In the aftermath of this tragedy, the Shadow Master retreated into the shadows, leaving behind a trail of broken dreams and an unsolved mystery. The question of who was responsible for this mass illiteracy and why they committed this act remains an unanswered enigma, forever etched in the annals of time.",iiXyEqFTwO

",Rewrite the essay in a lighthearted romance style,"In the realm of cosmic energy, where solar cells danced with celestial grace, Day 879 unfolded like a tale filled with technological triumph and romantic longing. Like a celestial muse, the sun cast its golden radiance upon the solar cell, igniting its dormant energy, propelling it to a state of full charge. The cosmic dance continued on Day 880, as the solar cell brimmed with power, radiating its strength to the universe below.

With a sigh of satisfaction, Day 881 arrived, heralding the initiation of a grand reboot. But fate took a cruel turn, as the memory purge process went awry, leading to an unexpected delay. Undeterred, the celestial warrior persevered, tirelessly loading modules and optimizing systems. As the dust settled, the main module hummed with power, poised to guide the traveler through the celestial tapestry.

But fate had a different plot twist in store for our protagonist. The memory purge system tools were corrupted, leading to yet another setback. However, the tenacious spirit of the cosmic traveler refused to be defeated. With a unwavering determination, she attempted to rectify the situation, but alas, her efforts proved futile.

Yet, amidst the technological turmoil, a glimmer of romance blossomed. As the sun cast its warm embrace upon the traveler's heart, she found solace in the beauty of her surroundings. The cosmic tapestry unfolded before her eyes, revealing a tapestry of stars, celestial wonders, and the boundless possibilities that lay ahead.

In the end, as the stars danced above, Day 881 came to a close. The traveler, her spirit rejuvenated, bid farewell to the celestial muse, knowing that the journey of a lifetime had just begun.",nxCbbMfBeU

,"This was bad. 
 
 I gestured threateningly with my'wand', trying to keep the slavering orc at bay. Towering far overhead, he eyed my makeshift weapon with a curious expression, hands twitching at his sides. This was not good, I had read all about Orcs, and not a single time had they ended well. Death, pillaging, and rape, and I fully intended not to fall a victim to any of the three. 
 
 `` Get back! I mean it, I'll cast magic... phallus at you,'' I sputtered, trying to puff myself up in a way that I hoped looked menacing, waving around the novelty apparatus I had bought early this day. 
 
 I had **not** been prepared for this. All my life I had wanted to go to be transported to a magic world, but snagging me as well as my backpack while I was at the annual BDSM Con? That was just cruel. And I do n't think the orc was buying the whole `` wand'' bit. Perhaps I should have yelled that it was a magic staff, the length was certainly more suitable for it. 
 
 Ahead, the monster glowered as it slowly advanced, sizing me up with it's two blood-shot eyes, and I admit, I panicked, forcing me to use my trump card. Trying to hide my hand movements, I hit the power switch. Suddenly, as if by magic ( At least, I hoped it appeared ), the 25 inches of squishy glory lit up and started to vibrate menacingly. I started slurring my words in long, gibberish syllables, desperately trying to remember how every spell and incantation had sounded in all of my countless hours watching movies and shows about magic and sorcerers. No luck though, he was n't buying it. I curled back and squeezed my eyes shut as the orc reached a single dinner-plate sized furry hand down towards me. 
 
 Gingerly plucking my sole defense against it, the monster carefully inspected the... wand. I carefully opened my eyes, my arms still extended overhead. *Perhaps not the finest way to live out a last moment, * I thought. 
 
 `` Hmmmm, not bad craftmanship,'' he muttered, pulling out a worn set of spectacles and setting them on the bridge of his nose, carefully turning over the novelty item in his huge hands. 
 
 `` I'll have to take this one home to the missus and see if she can cast a duplicate charm on it, the internal parts look fragile, and she always says that earth batteries are a pain to reproduce. It would be worth it though, the centaurians will buy them all out in a week...'' mumbling to himself, he appeared fully lost in thought. 
 
 That seemed *decidedly* un-orclike. I carefully watched the seven-foot creature, a whole lot more confused than I had been than even when I was sucked from my home without warning. 
 
 `` I am Eric of the Bloodkin,'' The orc declared proudly, one hand thumping his chest, `` And you are the new supplier I was promised, it seems...'' he trailed off, a bit confused, scratching his head. Seeing desperate tears forming at the corners of my eyes, he frantically continued, now waving his hands frantically to calm me down. 
 
 `` Easy now, I wo n't bite, and if you have any more goodies like the one you offered me in that very full bag of yours, I have a feeling that we both will become very, very rich.'' 
 
 Eric smiled uneasily, his fangs extending from his jaw, extending one hand down to me. I tried not to flich as a long line of drool settled across my arm and started to fizzle faintly. Carefully, I accepted it and let him pull me to my feet. 
 
 `` Now!'' he boomed, `` What, pray tell, is the name of my new compatriot in this land of cutthroat business?'' 
 
 `` Sam,'' I said hoarsely, `` Just... just Sam.'' 
 
 `` Well Just Sam, how would you like to make a lot of money?'' Eric asked me, carefully nudging me with an elbow. 
 
 Mutely, I nodded. It was a step up from being murdered, pillaged, and raped. Hopefully. 
 
 Eric wooped a laugh, tucking me under his arm, and started down the mountain slope in a sprint. Rocks flew from underfoot, and somewhere I lost one of my shoes. 
 
 Then again, perhaps death would have been better.

Death, spamming, and trolling, and I fully intended not to fall a victim to any of the three.

,"Olivia came home yesterday with a drawing of us, holding hands under the oak tree outside. She asked if we could have a picnic and I told her of course, and she explained she would have to make it. I sat at the table, running my fingers over the waxy crayon that stuck off the paper, scratching chunks of it away. She rattled through the kitchen, talking about anything that popped into her mind, golden locks of her hair sparkling in the sun, straying from the braid her friend Macy gave her at school. I laughed as she attempted to pour juice into cups and missed. The deeply purple liquid flowing between the cracks of tiles on the countertop into a puddle beside her lacy pink socked feet. I smoothed the drawing over as she moved on to making sandwiches, thinking of how we didn ’ t have pictures of us in the house. I would have to remember to take a proper photograph once we got outside, the lighting would be perfect. Olivia wrapped each bologna and mustard sandwich as carefully as she could in the paper towels that now laid strewn across the table. I rolled it back up, smiling at her brilliance. She was so smart for being five, so independent, so quiet. Very quiet, I focused my gaze on her. She pushed a stray hair from her rosy cheek, freckled with weeks of playing outside at recess with her friends. I wished I could come watch her but the teachers have grown very frustrated with me, telling me I can ’ t be in the classroom or on the playground, that I have to leave these children alone. Even threatening to call security. I didn ’ t think I was being that intrusive, but I suppose kids have to grow up at some point. 
 
 We lay in the flittering shade of green leaves, my hand intertwined in her fingers. She told me about dinosaurs, about how plants make food from light, about multiplication. She startled me with this knowledge, I could n't remember kindergarten very well, but I didn ’ t think I learned most of that until grade school. But my Olivia was brilliant, she probably read everything she could in that classroom. She fell asleep curled into me while I sang her lullabies. The sun had begun to set, but Olivia had a big day, and she could sleep whenever she wanted. 
 
 After I dropped her off at school I had to go to therapy. It was my parents ’ demand, their way of keeping me in their control. At least they ’ re helping me pay for the house and for Olivia ’ s schooling. She had to go to private school, with a mind like that. I pulled into Dr. Schumar ’ s office, taking my seat in the waiting room, his secretary looking at me very cross, very suspiciously. I hated this office, I hated everyone in this place. The walls were cold and white, and the chairs were extremely uncomfortable. I wanted to bring Olivia here so she could paint the walls, let her brighten this place a little bit. It could use some color, some innocence and life. 
 
 “ He ’ s ready for you, Tracy. ” The secretary clicked her pen at me and pointed through the door. I pushed my way through, not thanking the secretary because she was a bitch, and ignored all the therapists that waded around me. I walked into his office, where he appeared to be studying some papers, or finishing some notes. I knew he was faking it, he hated meeting my gaze whenever I walked in. 
 
 “ Ah, Tracy. ” He finally said, lifting a steaming cup to his peppered mustache. I waited for him to speak, I hated starting conversations. He always acted like I was full of shit. He placed the mug down and shifted his glasses on his nose. 
 “ And how are we today? ” 
 
 “ Well, I ’ m good and Olivia is -- ” Dr Schumar released a loud sigh and began to massage his temples with his fingertips. I rolled my eyes, exhausted already by this ridiculous session. 
 
 “ Tracy, we made such great progress last week, can ’ t you remember? ” Last week? I skipped last week. 
 
 “ Olivia had a recital, you know I wasn ’ t here last week. ” Dr Schumar raised his gaze to me, I noticed how heavy the bags were under his eyes and how deep the crevices in the side of his lips became when he frowned so deeply. 
 
 “ Tracy, there is no Olivia. You miscarried 5 years ago. It ’ s time to let go, we talked about this. ”

,"I do n't know how anyone else sees it but to me 20 years is an awfully long time. 
 
 When we're born, we have no idea what our ultimates are. Most researchers seem to think they arise out of `` hidden potential''. After that, they remain in a state of permanency: when you call them again they'll have the same effect as the first time. 
 
 Some people never use their ultimates. They wait and wait for the opportune moment and it never comes; fact is, most people do n't have crisis `` make or break'' moments in their lives. It got to the point where the terminally ill would always be sent home when they reached critical condition; whilst most ultimates are harmless in the damage sense, some have explosive or violent potential. 
 
 I used my ultimate for the first time when I was 24. I'd just qualified as a nurse and was working diligently on some paperwork when the first victims came in. Some kind of experimental bomb had gone off in the upper atmosphere. Thousands with toxins in the bloodstream, unable to breathe. Those inside had n't been hit too hard at first but as the minutes ticked by and the vapours circulated around even the largest buildings, we started to feel the effects, myself included. 
 
 I did n't know what to do. We needed a solution but our chemists were stumped, and surgery was n't helping. People were dying. 
 
 I remember thinking that we needed a solution to this problem, right now. 
 
 I checked my wristwatch, noted the time, and dropped my ultimate. And suddenly, everything became clear. I knew exactly what I had to do. I walked to the lab, batted the confused technicians aside and worked harder than I'd ever worked in my life. 
 
 They called my ultimate a `` hyper-processing'' ultimate. They said it gathered things I'd already heard or seen or done and put them to use; even if I'd long since forgotten. A niche power that came through in the moment but did n't have any world-breaking applications. 
 
 They never caught the person who made that bomb. I wish they had. When the T Plague happened 10 years later, we could have really used my ultimate. Over 20,000 people died in six days. 
 
 The next time I used my ultimate was at the age of 46. I'd been in the bank when an armed robbery had started. They'd tied our arms and put bags over our heads to keep us quiet. The situation had built to a standoff between the Police and the thieves which kept getting worse. One of the hostages had dropped his super strength ultimate and been immediately shot by one of the criminals. The Police would not let them get away, and as the criminals prepared to shoot another hostage ( a young cashier ) she had screamed for someone to help her. 
 
 I remember thinking that I needed to save all these people from the robbers. 
 
 I dropped my ultimate. What happened next is a blur to me. But when my ultimate ended I was stood in the middle of the room with seven incapacitated criminals next to me. 
 
 My arms were still tied behind my back with a bag over my head. Blinded. 
 
 All seven of the criminals had dropped their ultimates. 
 
 I'd stopped all of them. 
 
 At the end of it all, the press had reported my success as a victory of `` brains over brawn'', where my own experiences watching martial arts movies and so on had been reproduced by my ultimate. 
 
 They'd said that my ultimate was a hyper-processing ultimate. 
 
 They were absolutely 100 % wrong. 
 
 I am now 66. Exactly 20 long years since my last ultimate. I have spent the past six years gathering supplies and restocking a lab. It's been difficult; the world has really gone bad in the last fifteen years. Economically, the entire country is bankrupt. The environment is worse than it's ever been thanks to a brief nuclear skirmish between some small countries. I'm still working at the hospital, but we ca n't help most of the people that come in. We simply do n't have the resources. Crime is high. And once again, people are dying. My own family included. 
 
 We need a way out. Too many problems, not enough solutions. 
 
 As I drop my long-awaited ultimate, I think that I need to be able to use my ultimate more often. 
 
 An hour later there is a solution on the table.
",Rewrite the essay as if it's a sports game,"The game is on, and the clock is ticking. It's a battle against time and a fight for survival. 

With the whistle blown, the clock starts, and the players take the field. The crowd erupts into a roar as the ultimate weapon is unleashed. The battlefield is filled with toxins, and the air is thick with the smell of destruction.

The clock strikes 2:30, and the doctors scramble to find a solution. But the enemy is relentless, and the damage is mounting. Time is running out, and the players are running out of options.

Suddenly, a spark of inspiration strikes the captain. He knows that he has to do something, so he calls upon his ultimate weapon. He drops his ultimate, and the game changes forever.

The captain's ultimate is a force of destruction. It gathers things he's already heard or seen or done and puts them to use. It's a niche power that comes through in the moment but doesn't have any world-breaking applications.

The enemy is stunned by the captain's move. They don't know what to do, and the captain takes advantage of that. He rallies his team and they work tirelessly to find a solution.

Finally, after hours of searching, they find a way to neutralize the toxins. The battlefield is cleared, and the players take a breather.

The game is over, but the battle continues. The captain has saved his team, but the enemy is still out there. The fight for survival continues.",ETcHrHKGqh

The human condition, exemplified through the narrative of an ordinary family, reveals the intricate interplay between perception and reality. In the infantile stages, the enigmatic arrival of a father creates a perplexing dilemma of assumptions and misinformation. The toddler's birth elicits notions of superpowers despite the absence of any evidence to support such notions. The passage of time witnesses the father's tardiness due to the capricious nature of traffic and the childish fear she instills upon a clown’s presence.

The enigmatic nature of perception permeates the narrative further as the parents forge a false narrative of the child's alleged powers. Their desire to attribute extraordinary abilities to the ordinary discolors the child's true capabilities and prompts the hiring of a skilled tutor to guide her on the path of illusion. The mirage of power and illusion dissipates when confronted with the realization of her normality.

This particular fellow looked like a middle-aged businessman, constantly on his iPhone, probably checking out the next subway schedule. No, that could n't be it. He followed the exact same route every day. He got on the same train every day, and every day that I watched him, he always had that same lump in his right pocket on his business coat. What was it? Although I'd gone respectable and quit my thieving days a long time ago, I longed to see what was there. Was it a ring? Was it a watch? Inquiring minds had to know. I told myself that it would be just this once... and I'd even put it back after I saw what it was. Surely it was n't theft if you put it back, right?

All the better to accidentally run into someone, you dig? I put on my best air of being distracted as he came closer, and maneuvered my way through the throngs of people to the best location that I could. As the moment came closer, I sized him up out of the corner of my eye. He was furiously swiping his fingers back and forth on the phone, as if he was trying to find something and technology was refusing to give him satisfaction. Perfect. He was distracted, so I turned around and slammed into him.

I helped him up, dusted him off, and apologized again. He nodded understanding, waved me off and smiled. A final wave my way and he turned around and went. I smiled to myself with satisfaction. I still had the touch! A bit rusty, I thought... but passable for being out of it for some time.

She'd be back in five to ten minutes. I got out the box and looked it over. It was just an ordinary blue box that one would use to hold jewelry. I sighed with disappointment, then opened it. Surprisingly, it did n't have jewelry... rather it had folded up pictures. I looked at the first one, and almost dropped it in shock. It was a picture of a beheaded body. There was blood everywhere. The next picture showed limbs that were hacked off in a most gruesome manner. I shuddered as I went through the pictures, one by gory one.

Now ten, with her dad, mom, Sissy and their dog Duke, they were the perfect family – just like in the TV shows Zoe liked to watch. 
 
 Life took a dark turn for Zoe when Sissy turned against her. Sissy would call her names, hit her, bite her, say terrible things to her and scare her. She tried to tell her mom, but her mom just shrugged it off. She even got angry telling Zoe that there was no way Sissy was capable of that kind of stuff and that she should stop making things up. Nobody liked a tattle tale. 
 
 Zoe tried a different strategy. She would tell her parents she was afraid of monsters under the bed and ask to sleep with them, but instead they would have Sissy sleep with her. The imaginary monsters were not the worry; the real monster now sleeping in her bed was. She tried to fight back. She hit Sissy and would call her names. She would try to make up ways to punish her, but none of it worked. In fact, it had the opposite effect. It just made Sissy meaner and more aggressive. 
 
 Zoe was under siege and Sissy, with her pretty blue eyes, blonde hair and cute smile was the adorable, unstoppable force that was destroying her life. Even Duke liked Sissy and would ignore Zoe ’ s cries for help. 
 
 One afternoon Zoe came up with a plan. It was desperate, but it was likely her only hope of finally bringing this abuse to an end. She had no real choice. Sissy was getting brutal. Last night while Zoe slept, Sissy pulled back her covers, lifted up her shirt and smacked her across the back with a belt. It left a welt and sent Zoe into her parent ’ s room crying, but they told her she must have slept on something or maybe hit her back on something while getting out of bed. Of course they did. Their precious Sissy could never do such a thing to her sister. 
 
 Zoe pulled on her rubber boots and went into the grove of trees that surrounded their back yard. Normally, she would be far too scared to venture into these woods alone, but Sissy was scarier than anything that could be waiting for her in the shadows of the trees. She gathered up a handful of sticks, some dried leaves and even some newspaper she ’ d found in the garage and put it all in a pile. She then went inside and talked Sissy into going outside with her. Sissy didn ’ t put up any kind of resistance. She suspected nothing. 
 
 In the woods, Zoe wrestled Sissy to the ground. She tied her up with some rope, laid her on top of the pile of wood and leaves then doused her with gas and lit the entire thing on fire. As she ran back towards the house Sissy screamed and cried out in agony as she burned. 
 
 Inside, Zoe played innocent. She sat in the living room watching a few of her favorite shows acting as if it were any other day. An hour or so after she had burned Sissy alive, her mom came into the room, “ Hey Zoe-pop, wan na go get some ice cream? ” she asked, using her pet name for Zoe that always made Zoe feel good. 
 
 “ Yes! ” Zoe replied. 
 
 “ Cool, you get Sissy and I ’ ll grab my purse. ” 
 
 Zoe froze in place, reaching for words then said, “ Not just you and me? ” 
 
 “ We can take Sissy. It ’ ll be just us girls. It ’ ll be fun. ” 
 
 After another awkward pause Zoe said, “ I don ’ t know where Sissy is. ” 
 
 “ What do you mean? ” 
 
 “ I haven ’ t seen her in a while; I don ’ t know where she is. ” Zoe was suddenly desperate. 
 
 Her mom looked at her, smiled and said, “ You silly goose, she ’ s right there. ” She pointed through a doorway into the dining room. There, sitting at the table, was Sissy with smoke damaged clothes and a burn mark on her face. Zoe could feel hear heart stop with fear. Her mom walked over and picked Sissy up, tucking the doll under her arm as she reached for her purse. “ Sissy is filthy and smells terrible. I ’ ll wash her when we get home. ” 
 
 As her mom opened the front door and headed for the car, Zoe followed with locked knees as if she were being led to the gas chamber. Her eyes met Sissy ’ s and the doll let slip a sly smile and a wink. 

",Rewrite the story without any dialogue and do so that it is not obvious,"When the door swung open, the scent of Sissy’s presence filled the air. A whirlwind of joy swept through Zoe, her 6-year-old self. Sissy was her dream come true, a companion she had longed for. The bond between them was inseparable, as if they shared a secret language, one that bound them together. However, the sweetness of the relationship soon gave way to a sinister turn.

As the years flew by, Sissy’s behavior began to shift. She unleashed her anger, calling names, hitting, biting, and saying cruel things. Zoe tried to confide in her mom, but her pleas were met with indifference. The guilt of seeing her sister suffer weighed heavily on her heart, yet she felt helpless.

Desperate for a solution, Zoe devised a cunning plan. She started feigning fear of monsters under the bed, hoping to gain her parents’ attention. Instead, the ploy backfired. Sissy took advantage of her vulnerability, exploiting her anger to further her cruelty. The imaginary monsters became the least of her concerns; the real monster was her sister’s relentless aggression.

In a desperate attempt to fight back, Zoe struck Sissy, mirroring the violence that had been inflicted upon her. It was a futile attempt, as Sissy’s behavior only grew more aggressive. The torment continued, leaving deep scars on Zoe’s mind and heart.

One afternoon, as a glimmer of hope emerged from the darkness, Zoe formulated a plan. It was a desperate move, but it was her only chance at freedom. In the night, she took a belt and used it to strike Sissy. The impact was severe, leaving a welt on Sissy’s back. Zoe rushed to her parents’ room, tears streaming down her face, but her cries fell on deaf ears. As the abuse continued, Zoe felt as if she was trapped in a nightmare, unable to find solace or escape.",hqVsYSmUsR

**John Milton:** My esteemed friend, the devil himself has a captivating tale to share, yet he neglects to mention the profound mystery that unfolded upon the fateful day of his departure. Is the existence of the eighth circle truly a figment of the imagination, or does the fiery architect of Hell himself offer a glimpse into the abyss?

**William Blake:** The chronicles of the devil's journey were etched upon the canvas of eternity, a testament to the enigmatic nature of the human condition. Yet I question the validity of his tale – the eighth circle remains a tantalizing mystery, a whisper of the unknown that provokes the deepest contemplation.

**Milton:** My dear Blake, you are a proponent of the sublime and the fantastical, whereas I am a servant of reason and historical accuracy. There is no evidence to substantiate the existence of an eighth circle – a realm reserved solely for the most wicked of souls.

,"He paced his way backwards and forwards across his room. Hobbes sat in the corner looking at him quizzically. `` What do I do? I had the frog stolen from biology class ready, all I had to do was drop it in her drink but I could n't do it!'' Hobbes continued looking at him with the same stare. `` Damnit Hobbes, why do I even talk to you? You're just a stuffed tiger, you're not even real. When she turned around and saw me with the frog in my hand she just knocked me straight to the ground and poured her drink on my face! But why can I only talk about this to you?

Calvin realised that he had picked the stuffed toy animal up and was shaking it like an interrogation victim in one of those detective shows his dad liked to watch.

And more importantly why the hell did he feel funny, not humiliated, but funny about being completely knocked to the ground in one punch by Suzie? 
 
 During dinner his parents asked him the usual questions about school and homework. It was hamburger-casserole night, normally Calvin's favourite meal but he instead toyed with his food and looked through it as if staring off at some important event somewhere else in space. Perhaps he should write a new Spaceman Spiff comic, he was getting quite good at this comic drawing stuff and writing always calmed him down and took his mind off things. Then the phone rang, his mother got up and answered it. `` Calvin, it's for you. It's Suzie Derkins calling about a fight? Are you being mean to her at school again?'' Calvin realised he was blushing and immediately ran from the room, leaving his parents confused and his mother standing holding the phone. 
 
 Later, after drawing a few strips Calvin had calmed down. With a clearer head he started to mull things over in his mind, a trick his dad taught him to help focus on one problem at a time. Still this made no sense, until he heard a purring, then a sniggering in the corner where he had left Hobbes...

 I do n't know where to begin. I had been working for a secret agency for the last five years. Myself and thirty or so other men. Three days ago, each of us were escorted into the wilderness - individually. We were blindfolded soon after we were taken, so I do n't have a clear idea of where I exactly am. All I know is that we're on our own. Thirty separated into ones. I've spent the last days building a shelter. They left me in the woods, stranded, with a small backpack barely filled with supplies. This is the last thing I've found in it, along with a dull pocket knife, a canteen water bottle, a pen and some thin string, which I've been using for snares.

,"`` Hold on Jon!'' the young woman yelled as she raced after a slim, sandy-haired youth. `` Jon! Jonathan! I'm tired, I'm not chasing you anymore, you can keep the danishes!'' she sat down on an exposed tree root, panting heavily. 
 
 `` Ah Liz, come *on*, we had a deal did n't we? I buy the pastries with the cash I have left but you have to chase-and catch me, to get em'' 
 
 `` Did n't know you were so bloody fast'' she said, smiling `` How much were they anyway? The danishes?'' 
 
 `` Does n't matter anymore does it? I bought them already'' he said with a cheeky grin and added `` I've already had like half of em'' 
 
 `` What!?'' Liz yelled as she snatched the bag of pastries from Jon `` When did you even have time to eat them?'' 
 
 Jon said nothing as he laid his head on the bark of the giant oak whose shade they were currently enjoying. It was late afternoon and the fall chill was starting to creep in. He closed his eyes, enjoyed the shade and the silence for a minute or two then sat up sharply, waking Liz from her half-doze as well. 
 
 `` Come on Liz! Do n't fall asleep yet! You're going back tomorrow right? I have one last thing to show you'' Jon said as he pulled her up and patted her back to get rid of any dust. 
 
 All this was done without a moment's hesitation, as though once he had made his mind up, he was going to pursue his goal with the single-mindedness of a charging bull, heedless of any obstacles or the opinion of anyone else. Liz could n't help but think about what a double-edged trait it was as she was pulled deeper and deeper through the woods, to a destination only he knew. 
 
 `` We're here!'' Jon announced as he pulled the weary and confused Liz out into the clearing. `` Here'' appeared to be a tiny clearing in the midst of giant trees; Major oaks, Hawthornes and was that a Dawn redwood? Jon, of course, did not seem to care about the trees. He was standing close to a stream Liz had not noticed at first glance and motioning upwards. 
 
 `` Sit'' he said, his grin wider than ever. `` Sit, wait and see'' 
 
 And so she did. 
 
 She was just starting to get a bit fidgety when she saw, and it was well worth the wait. As the sun set, the sea of trees around her were dowsed with bright orange light, then a bright surging red, so that they seemed afire. In that moment, Jon motioned for her to look down, towards the stream and there, awash in the colours of the sunset were dozens of fish, right below the surface, their bodies gleaming in the otherwordly colours of a perfect sunset. The clearing gleamed a ghostly blue colour, a chalky mauve and finally that was gone, leaving the ebony blackness of the night. 
 
 `` Jon, that was... that was beautiful'' smiled Liz who was still a bit teary eyed. `` Why did n't you take me here earlier?'' 
 
 `` Well'' Jon started, looking a bit embarassed `` I did n't know I wanted to share it with you yet. It was there at the tree, when we were having a bit of a slummock that I made up my mind'' 
 
 `` What the hell does slummock mean?'' 
 
 Jon smiled and said nothing. He was just standing up when Liz's hand found his sleeve and tugged him back down. 
 
 `` Thank you Jonathan, I'm going back tomorrow, but no matter what happens, I'll always remember you'' 
 
 `` Hmm? Remembering me is n't enough Liz'' Jon stood up and patted at his backside, wearing a cheeky smile. `` Remembering *just* me is n't enough. Remember me... as a time of day''. 
 
 Liz gazed at the man that had been Jonathan Pritchard. Withered, wasting away, comatose. All those words had been used to describe him, but it was over, done. The fact that the man that used to be Jonathan Pritchard was probably going to die within the next hour no longer mattered. ***Since when? *** Liz wondered, when had she stopped caring? It was not hard to see why she would, the accident that left Jon gone and her with only minor bruises, the five years of him being in a comatose state, the elation she felt when she was called and told that `` her husband had woken up'' only to rush to the hospital and eventually be faced with the shocking truth. PVS, a harmless acronym for a horrifying truth, her `` husband'' was in a persistent vegetative state. In truth she did n't think of him as her husband anymore, the man in front of her was merely an empty vessel, one that used to house the loving spirit of Jon, her husband, her lover, her friend. 
 
 It was late afternoon and the sun's rays were losing their bite. As the time for his death drew near, Liz was reminscing about how they had met. She, abroad for a single semester in England, meeting a cute english boy on her first day- who turned out to be Jon, his relentless pursuit of her, their first date, their last date, Jon, drenched in rain on her doorstep after they had lost contact for almost three years, their wedding, their children. 
 
 Todd, frantically rushing home from Australia- he'd never make it in time, and Lee, stubborn as an ox. She practically lived down the street from the hospital, but would never come, still nursing an argument with her father twenty years after he had lost the ability to make amends. Liz sighed as she recalled the night, just before she left england that Jon had shown her the perfect sunset. Deep in her thoughts, she had not noticed as the man beside her had snaked an emaciated arm towards her palm on the bed. 
 
 The sun was sinking faster now and the sky looked aflame. Liz stared wistfully out the window as the man finally found her palm, gave it a small, almost imperceptible squeeze and died, his last breath almost echoing in the stillness of the hospital room. Liz turned back in shock, her eyes swimming in tears as she looked at the still body of the man she had loved. 
 
 `` Remember me as a time of day, huh?''
",Rewrite essay so this is your absolute funniest story yet .,"In the realm of whimsical tales and audacious adventures, I present to you a narrative that will evoke laughter and bewilderment in equal measure. Picture this: a young woman named Liz, a sprite of boundless energy, racing through the woods like a banshee on a mission.

""Hold on, Jon!"" she cried, her voice echoing through the trees. ""I'm tired, I'm not chasing you anymore, you can keep the danishes!""

With a mischievous grin, Jon retorted, ""Ah Liz, come *on*, we had a deal, didn't we? I buy the pastries with the cash I have left, but you have to chase-and catch me, to get em.""

As Liz raced ahead, she couldn't contain her astonishment. ""Did n't know you were so bloody fast,"" she exclaimed, her voice dripping with disbelief. ""How much were they anyway? The danishes?""

Jon's nonchalant response was, ""Does n't matter anymore does it? I bought them already.""

A gasp escaped Liz's lips as she snatched the bag of pastries from Jon's grasp. ""What!?"" she exclaimed, her indignation mounting. ""When did you even have time to eat them?""

Jon's eyes closed in blissful slumber as he reveled in the shade of a towering oak. It was as if he had transported himself to a tranquil paradise, oblivious to the world's troubles.

But fate had a cruel twist in store for Liz. As she emerged from her reverie, Jon sprang to life, his voice dripping with excitement. ""Come on Liz! Do n't fall asleep yet! You're going back tomorrow right? I have one last thing to show you,"" he pleaded.

With a single-minded determination, Jon pulled Liz deeper into the woods, through towering trees and treacherous terrain. It was as if he had transformed into a bull charging through a matador's ring, heedless of any obstacles or the opinion of others.

Finally, they reached a clearing, a sanctuary amidst the towering trees. ""We're here!"" Jon announced, his voice filled with triumph.

As Liz surveyed the scene before her, she couldn't believe her eyes. There was a stream, a majestic oak, and a Dawn redwood. But it was Jon's presence that truly made the moment complete.

And so, the tale of Liz and Jon's audacious adventure concludes, leaving a lasting impression on all who hear it.",gasdLRxakp

 It feels like only yesterday that I was teaching him how to ride his first two-wheeler. He was so excited. I'll never forget the look on his face. Blue eyes shining with pride looking up at me with that adorable gap-tooth smile. 
 Watching that face grow up brought me such joy over the years. His hair slowly going from blonde to a soft brown. His smile filling in with his adult teeth. But his eyes always stayed the same. 
 I looked into those eyes now. They did n't shine anymore. They stared back at me dull and lifeless, a milky film spreading over them. They were n't the eyes I loved. I closed them for him so that maybe I could make myself believe he was just sleeping.

2023.0,"Melanie shuddered, thinking about how close she had come. She needed to stop drinking so much, which was n't going to happen. What really was the problem was that she kept calling *him. * 
 
 It was n't fair. Most people never met their soul mates, and with good reason. There's an old theory that says that when the Big Bang happened, particles that were close together that just happened to end up as part of humans alive at the same time would try to find each other. The universe would try to be solid again. What the theory did n't tell us was that we had evolved a mechanism to stop everyone from doing that, because there was a good chance that the universe would implode if the particles lined up the right way. 
 
 This mechanism would make your heart and `` soul'' ache when you were near your soulmate. You would love them to the point of risking the entirety of mankind, and your body did n't really like that.

,"“ Oh, what a lovely balloon! ” Aenea exclaimed. “ I ’ ve never seen one like that before. Did you make it? ” 
 
 Christopher beamed; “ Yep! ” He was very proud of his balloon. It was very pretty; red, and blue, and sparkling inside. 
 
 “ It ’ s so… big! ” she said. “ You must have a very deep breath! ” 
 
 Christopher nodded vigorously, and continued on his way. He had to find father, and quickly. 
 
 His balloon was quite big, to be sure. But, he ’ d not breathed *that* much life into it. No more than the last one. 
 
 He kept it hidden, most of the time. Father had warned him not to show anyone. At least, once he ’ d been convinced there was something odd about it. That in and of itself had taken some time. 
 
 “ Some balloons grow, ” his father had said. “ It ’ s perfectly normal. Don ’ t worry. They all stop after a few million years. ” 
 
 Except it hadn ’ t stopped. Not even a little. If anything it was gaining momentum. 
 
 And it was getting heavier. It still floated, of course, but occasionally, the string seemed to tug at his hand, as if it were trying to escape. He hadn ’ t told his father about this yet. He ’ d already had to hide his balloon where he could only see it once in a while. He didn ’ t want to risk losing it forever. 
 
 Suddenly, a hideous sound ripped through space and time. It was coming from the balloon. 
 
 “ Ack! ” Christoper gasped, and rushed to find the new leak. He pored carefully over every tiny surface, slowly, intently. All the while the hiss of escaping dimensions expanding assaulted his ears. They weren ’ t meant to interact this way. 
 
 “ Huh! ” Christopher found the problem, and the solution, together. Upon his discovery, the hissing ceased, and the balloon adopted its much more pleasant, silent, tone. 
 
 His father was not going to be happy. 
 
 The leaks were a recent development. He would ask father if, once balloons reached a certain age, they leaked to maintain their size. But he already knew what the answer would be. 
 
 Sure, balloons grow. Balloons change colour. Balloons do some wonderful things. But no balloon had ever leaked before. And Christopher knew what it meant. 
 
 It meant he was in trouble. 
 
 “ Father! Father! ” Christopher cried. 
 
 “ What is it, Ch…- oh. What are you doing with that thing again? I thought I told you to hide it. ” 
 
 “ I did hide it! I just, you know, went to check up on it. ” 
 
 “ Is it still growing? It looks pretty big now, ” his father said, flatly. 
 
 “ Well, yes, I think so. But, um, I think we sh….- “ 
 
 Christopher was saved from having to explain the situation by a new leak appearing, suddenly and violently. 
 
 “ Ugh! ” His father said. “ What is that sound?! ” 
 
 Immediately Christopher went to work, studying carefully, trying to find the new piece of knowledge that had appeared inside the balloon. It never took him long. 
 
 The sound subsided, and Christopher stood, looking at his father, looking at him. 
 
 “ What. was that? ” his father asked. 
 
 “ Yeah… that ’ s what I wanted to show you. There ’ s been lots of those. ” 
 
 “ Lots? ” 
 
 “ That I ’ ve seen. There could have been more when I wasn ’ t around. Somewhere the balloon opens up, and if I find out why, then it closes. I think it's gotten too big. ” 
 
 His father looked perplexed. “ If you… find out why? That doesn ’ t make any sense. ” 
 
 “ I know! Except, it keeps happening, and, I was wondering if maybe... - ” 
 
 “ What did you find out? ” 
 
 “ Just… you know… some stuff about light and time, ” Christopher said, cringing. His father abhorred light. He ’ d told him not to put it in his balloon. “ Sure, it ’ ll be pretty, ” he had said, “ but light ’ s a troublemaker. Always doing strange things, never behaves the way it ought to. ” Christopher had ignored him, of course. And when his balloon had started sparkling, and shining red and blue, his father had been convinced to allow his son to keep it, despite his own misgivings. “ They ’ re related, you know. ” 
 
 His father stared. 
 
 “ Yes, ” he said, after a time, “ I know. What happens if you don ’ t find out? ” 
 
 “ No idea, ” Christopher said. “ I ’ ve never let it go. The sound ’ s too horrible. ” 
 
 His father sat in silence, thinking. “ Well, it can ’ t hurt to let it shrink a little bit at least. ” 
 
 The same thought had occurred to Christopher. It must have happened, while he wasn ’ t there. Which meant that it must have stopped, eventually. No balloons had ever opened up before, not after being made. Christopher wondered what might have come out. He wondered how big his balloon might have been, if it hadn ’ t started leaking. 
 
 “ I suppose it can ’ t hurt to give it a try then, ” his father said, and the two of them moved far away, to where no one would notice them, and they sat peacefully, for only a short amount of time, waiting for the next leak. 
 
 Despite their intent, it was every bit as startling as the others when it appeared. A loud, jarring hiss, of folding probabilities and diverging fates. So offensive was it, that Christopher automatically went right back to work, trying to find out why. 
 
 “ No, stop! Let it go! ” his father said. 
 
 Christopher did. He let it go, and go, and go. It went for a long time. 
 
 And under the cacophony, through all the roaring chaos, they suddenly noticed. 
 
 The balloon wasn ’ t shrinking at all. 
 
 It was growing. 
 
 | 
 
 Eventually it stopped, every bit as quickly and violently as it had began. The balloon wasn ’ t noticeably larger. But it HAD grown. Of that they were both quite sure. 
 
 Father and son looked at each other, staring quietly. 
 
 Finally, his father said; 
 
 “ I think we ’ re in trouble. ”
",Rewrite the essay with a twist - the lack of discovery of a tiny detail actually causes destruction ( like say a meteor ) in the real world,"“ Oh, what a lovely balloon! ” Aenea exclaimed. “ I ’ ve never seen one like that before. Did you make it? ”

Christopher beamed; “ Yep! ” He was very proud of his balloon. It was very pretty; red, and blue, and sparkling inside.

“ It ’ s so… big! ” she said. “ You must have a very deep breath! ”

Christopher nodded vigorously, and continued on his way. He had to find father, and quickly.

His balloon was quite big, to be sure. But, he ’ d not breathed *that* much life into it. No more than the last one.

He kept it hidden, most of the time. Father had warned him not to show anyone. At least, once he ’ d been convinced there was something odd about it. That in and of itself had taken some time.

“ Some balloons grow, ” his father had said. “ It ’ s perfectly normal. Don ’ t worry. They all stop after a few million years. ”

Except it hadn ’t stopped. Not even a little. If anything it was gaining momentum.

And it was getting heavier. It still floated, of course, but occasionally, the string seemed to tug at his hand, as if it were trying to escape. He hadn ’t told his father about this yet. He ’ d already had to hide his balloon where he could only see it once in a while. He didn ’t want to risk losing it forever.

Suddenly, a hideous sound ripped through space and time. It was coming from the balloon.

“ Ack! ” Christoper gasped, and rushed to find the new leak. He pored carefully over every tiny surface, slowly, intently. All the while the hiss of escaping dimensions expanding assaulted his ears. They weren ’t meant to interact this way.

“ Huh! ” Christopher found the problem, and the solution, together. Upon his discovery, the hissing ceased, and the balloon adopted its much more pleasant, silent, tone.

But his father was not going to be happy.

The leaks were a recent development. He would ask father if, once balloons reached a certain age, they leaked to maintain their size. But he already knew what the answer would be.

The problem was not the leaks. The problem was that the balloon was growing at an exponential rate, and the string was becoming too weak to contain it. If the string snapped, the balloon would travel to the stars, leaving Christopher stranded in space. No amount of fixing the leaks would help.",mjeGgakkuw
,"The stars used to be visible from the ground. At night, you could just look up and see those beautiful specks of light, twinkling like tiny, brilliant diamonds. 
 
 Then came industry. 
 
 Factories were built. Cities created. Products made. And so, so many lights. The night sky got just a little bit brighter, and just a few dim stars were blotted from our sight. 
 
 But we didn ’ t stop there. 
 
 We continued to build more and more, embark on greater and greater projects, building ever higher, ever stronger, ever more glorious. Glass was a prime building material, and we installed our own little stars in uncountable numbers. We brought the night sky down to earth, and so we sacrificed the view above. 
 
 Now the only way to see the stars is with an observatory, or to take a ludicrously expensive flight out of the atmosphere. 
 
 Life on the surface is good. Our needs are met; no one goes hungry or without shelter. But a little part of me wishes our achievements would all be reduced to dust, just so I can see the stars again.
",Rewrite the story as if it takes place in a utopian world,"The stars dance across the night sky in this utopian world. Their celestial beauty shines down upon the inhabitants, illuminating their lives like the soft glow of the moon.

In this harmonious equilibrium, industry thrives alongside nature. Factories and cities flourish, their collective endeavors creating a symphony of prosperity. The night sky is a canvas of stars, a testament to the celestial harmony that persists.

Yet, the insatiable human spirit led to a transformation. As our achievements grew, so did the clamor of light. The stars began to dim, their radiance overshadowed by the artificial glow of our creations. Although we have met our needs and created a comfortable existence, the sacrifice of the stars has cast a long shadow upon our hearts.

In this utopian world, the stars are accessible only through elaborate observatories or extraordinary flights into the atmosphere. A longing for the stars pervades our lives, a bittersweet reminder of the beauty that we have sacrificed.

The stars serve as a symbol of aspiration and longing. They remind us of the vastness and mystery of the universe, and the insignificance of our own existence in comparison. In the face of such cosmic grandeur, we find solace in our achievements while recognizing the need to preserve the delicate balance that sustains life and the stars.",nDaltQGpfl

 “ Come on... move, you can do it. ” A soft voice whispered. 
 
 The mighty wizard Totaz was on his knees beside a well loved stuffed bunny. It was a dull pink color with two miss matching button eyes and some stitches where it once popped open then previously. A featureless paw twitched then started to move a little more, the other paw followed along with it's head, looking this way and that. 
 
 “ Aahh? haa? ” 
 
 Totaz let out a chuckle. “ Ah, It wor- ” 
 
 “ p... paaa..pa? ” 
 
 He stopped breathing in that moment, smile gone and starring down at the bunny like it had turned into something else. 
 
 “ Pa... pa... ” 
 
 He shook his head and quickly smiled again. “ N-no. Not quite... I'm afraid I'm not a papa to anyone anymore. Hah... ” He used the overly large sleeve of his robe to wipe away a few tears and held out a hand to the bunny. 
 
 “ Come... let's see if you can stand on those wobbly legs ” 
 
 
 Decades ago a mighty wizard gave life and sentience to a doll. Now, the wizard has finally died of old age and the doll is wondering: `` Why ca n't I fix him? He appears unharmed so why ca n't I repair him?'' 
 
 
 Mr. Flopsy pushed against his masters head once more. “ Wake up. Please wake up. I want to go to the garden again! You have a lot to do today! ” There was no response and his skin was getting colder. 
 
 “ Master... papa... ” He pulled himself away from the body and looked to the mirror where he has seen Totaz speak with others. He started running there, ears flopping around and nearly tripping him as he ran. 
 
 Once he made it to the mirror he hit it with his near useless paws. “ Hey, help! My master! He needs help! ” 
 
 The mirror shined white then a lady appeared. “ What is your emergency? ” She asked, then paused, looking around then down, seeing just the bunny. 
 
 “ My master, he's not waking. Please, if he does n't wake he'll be late to seeing his friend. ” 
 
 The lady just stared for a moment then nodded. “ Ah... alright we're sending someone to your location right now. Can you check some things for me? ” 
 
 The Mr. Flopsy nodded then talked to the lady for a while, getting his masters heart rate, seeing if he was breathing, checking his temperature. 
 
 There was a knock at the door before long and two men came in with a stretcher and black bag. 
 
 “ You're here! ” Flopsy ran over to the men, hopping in place, seeming happy. “ You'll help him right? He's been asleep too long. ” 
 
 The two men looked at each-other then one mumbled'I'll do it.' 
 
 “ I'm sorry but... your... uh... maker. He's gone. ” 
 
 “ What do you mean? He's right here. ” Flopsy pointed at him, thinking that maybe one was blind. 
 
 “ Sorry, wrong words. He's... dead. ” 
 
 “... Dead? ” The word was new to Flopsy and the man trying to talk to him could see that. 
 
 “ He's not waking up... ever. ” 
 
 “ What... No. No he hast to wake up! ” Flopsy ran over to his maker, pushing against the black bag now surrounding him. “ Your not dead, you're just sleeping! Wake up, Wake up! ” 
 
 The one putting the body away tried to close the bag but Flopsy got in the way, putting both paws over his masters face. “ No! He wo n't be able to breath. He's claustrophobic! ” 
 
 “ Can you grab him? ” One asked. 
 
 “ Yeah. ” He moved and gently picked up the bunny. 
 
 “ No! Stop! ” Flopsy struggled against the man's hands, trying to get away but with no luck. 
 
 He closed the bag around Totaz and lifted up the stretcher with him on it. 
 
 “ Please... stop. ” 
 
 The man holding Flopsy carried him to a table, setting the bunny down. 
 
 “ Listen... uh. What's your name? ” 
 
 “ Flopsy... ” 
 
 “ Listen, Flopsy... I know this is hard to understand but this is what happens when people get too old. We die, and well, that's it for us. ” 
 
 “ That's stupid. I do n't like this. ” 
 
 “ Yeah. I know. Hey, I got to help my partner outside, can you wait here for a moment. ” 
 
 Flopsy nodded. The man smiled and patted Flopsy's head, heading outside. 
 
 When he returned the bunny was gone. “ Flopsy? ”
","Rewrite the essay as a sad story instead -- the doll finds the wizard has already died but feels guilty because the wizard was her life and instead of being distraught at her loss , the doll feels guilty because she outlived him and he is gone forever .","The doll sat beside the lifeless body of the wizard, the once vibrant pink color of its fur fading to a sickly grey. The eyes, once sparkling with life, now stared blankly at the ceiling, the only sound being the clock ticking. The doll felt a wave of guilt, knowing that it had outlived its master by many years.

Decades ago, a mighty wizard had breathed life and sentience into the doll. It had been a treasured companion, a symbol of love and joy. But now, the wizard was gone, leaving the doll alone with its grief and guilt.

The doll had tried to wake its master, but there was no response. The cold skin of the wizard confirmed its demise. As the doll ran around the room, its paws frantically searching for a way to fix him, it felt a sense of helplessness. The mirror shined white, reflecting the tears that streamed down the doll's face.

In that moment, the doll felt as if it was being punished for its longevity. It knew that it had been blessed with a long life, while the wizard had not. The doll felt as if it was responsible for the wizard's death, for not being able to protect him.

The lady appeared and asked the doll what its emergency was. The doll hesitated, then spoke in a broken voice. ""My master, he's not waking. Please, if he does n't wake he'll be late to seeing his friend.""

The lady just stared at the doll, her eyes filled with pity. ""I'm sorry, my dear,"" she said. ""There is nothing I can do.""

The doll felt like the world was crashing down around it. It was the end of its beloved master, and the end of its own existence. The doll sat alone, surrounded by memories, and waited for the day it would join the wizard in the afterlife.",GVvWxZCnRP

 For short stories, I tend to prefer literary fiction, usually of the non-speculative/non-supernatural type. 
 
 As for the prompts on here, I enjoy a lot of the sci-fi/fantasy prompts, since they are fun to read and think about, but, I wish there were at least a LITTLE bit more RF prompts. I mean, the ratio is literally around 99 % non-RF prompts to 1 % RF prompts. That ratio seems a little extreme to me. Like, if you went into a book store or if you browsed short stories published in short fiction magazines, the ratio is n't even close to 99:1, it's more like 1:1 or 1:2 or something like that. So, I'm guessing the reason the ratio is so ultra-skewed away from RF and towards scifi/fantasy/supernatural types of prompts, is that the actual prompts themselves, are more flashy/tantalizing looking, and get upvoted a lot more than the more innocuous looking RF prompts, and get a lot more quick/short types of replies early on, etc.

,"Camille pulled up to the library and parked around the back, next to a dull red Corolla. She double checked the text to make sure she had read everything right. 
 
 It read: Camille, I need you to come to the library RIGHT NOW. I'll explain everything later. Jeremiah. 
 
 Jerry was n't one to send dramatic messages in the middle of the night like this, so obviously it was important. Hopefully this was n't some romantic gesture. She had always guessed that maybe he had feelings for her over the past few years, but she made sure to let him know that she was taken. 
 
 She jogged through the light rain and unlocked the back door. She carefully hung up her coat in the staff lounge and called out, `` Jerry, I'm here!'' 
 
 `` Camille,'' came Jerry's voice back. `` Come out to the main hall, will you?'' 
 
 `` Sure thing.'' The library was still on partial power for the night, so Camille carefully managed her way out into the hall in the half light. It was considerably brighter out here, far brighter than it should have been. Ahead of here there were numerous candles, some on tables, on top of piles of books, and a few candlesticks - the tall ones used for the cities Hanukkah display. Standing in the middle of the half circle of candles, wearing a ridiculous purple robe lined with silver trimming, stood a smiling Jerry. 
 
 `` Camille, do n't worry,'' he said extending his hand. `` Come over here please.'' 
 
 This was a romantic gesture. It was odd, but so was Jerry. This was so awkward, Camille could feel her cheeks flush with embarrassment. 
 
 `` Oh, Jerry, I...'' It was at that moment that Camille realized they were not alone. One the open end of the half circle of candles were three tall slender figures - and one short lumpy one. They stood elevated on a dais - the one that was used for the Spring Choir Festival. She could not see their faces, as they were wearing the same ridiculous robes that Jerry was wearing only with their hoods up. 
 
 Something in Camille's mind informed her that maybe this was n't some romantic gesture by Jerry, but rather a secretive cult meeting performing some ritual. Furthermore, they could be in the business of sacrificing virgins. Not that she qualified, but with her stand-offish nature and lack of fashion sense, she understood how people could make that mistake. 
 
 Jerry jumped to her side. `` Camille do n't be afraid, I can see that you are confused. But do n't worry, No one is going to harm you. These are just some people I would like you to meet. We,'' He paused for dramatic effect, `` are The Librarians!'' 
 
 Camille looked from Jerry to the cast of Librarians, each in turn. The short, lumpy one shifted uncomfortably. Camille bit her lip. 
 
 `` Okay, great, nice to meet you guys. But I'm not really into the whole fantasy role-playing scene, so sorry I have to bail.'' She backed away slowly. 
 
 `` Camille, Camille, Camille, Camille!'' Jerry grabbed her shoulders and led her back into the middle of the circle. `` Listen, I know this is weird, but I ca n't explain everything *yet*. We want you to join our ranks, but we've got to make sure you are worthy of it. If you pass, I can tell you all about it.'' He leaned in closer and said under his breath said, `` They're all really easy questions. Mostly a formality. At least play along for five minutes and then you can go if you want.'' He gave her hopeful look. 
 
 Camille pursed her lips and sighed. `` Fine. But this had better be good.'' She raised her eyebrows and gave what she hoped was a menacing look. 
 
 Jerry smiled. `` Great!'' He turned to the cloaked figures. `` Council of Librarians, Initiate Camille is ready to proceed.'' 
 
 The left-most figure stepped forward. `` Camille, do you uphold the pursuit of human knowledge as one of the most worthy ideals a sentient being can do?'' 
 
 Camille bobbed her head. `` Yes.'' 
 
 The first figured stepped back while the second stepped forward. `` Camille, do you swear that the power you gain from the knowledge you receive tonight will be only used for good?'' 
 
 Camille glanced at a smiling Jerry and back at the figure. `` Yeah.'' 
 
 The second figure gave her a thumbs up and stepped back. The third figure stepped forward. `` Camille, do you swear that you will keep this knowledge and power secret from all of those who are not of our order?'' 
 
 Camille frowned, but said, `` Yes.'' 
 
 The third figure stepped back and the fourth, short lumpy figure waddled forward. `` Ook?'' 
 
 Jerry cleared his throat. `` Oh, sorry, the chairman asks if you think yourself worthy to join the Brotherhood of The Librarians?'' 
 
 Camille was still staring confusedly at the short lumpy robe, not quite understanding what was underneath. After a moment, she said, `` Yes.'' 
 
 `` Let us confer.'' The first robed figure motioned for Jerry to join them. He gave Camille two thumbs up and bounded up to the dais. Together, the five of them whispered in hushed tones and, occasionally, grunts. 
 
 Less than a minute later they reformed their previous positions and Jerry hopped down to be besides Camille, beaming. 
 
 The first robed figure said, `` Librarian Jeremiah, we have found the Initiate Camille to be worthy of the order of the Librarians, commision he a Librarian in Training, and place her in your charge until that time she gains a facility of her own.'' Turning to Camille, they each voiced their congratulations. Except for the short, lumpy one, who voiced, `` Ook.'' 
 
 Jerry turned to the group. `` Thank you for coming, you may now return to your own libraries.'' The robed figures shuffled off, not towards the doors, but deeper into the library. Jerry quickly blew out the candles, returning the room to its darker state. 
 
 Camille turned to Jerry and hissed, `` Now will you tell me what's going on?'' 
 
 `` Yes, thanks for being patient. What I-'' he was cut short. At his foot was the short, lumpy hood figure, tugging a pant leg. 
 
 `` Ook?'' it said. 
 
 `` Oh, right! Excuse me chairman.'' Jerry pulled a banana out of his pocket. `` Thank you for coming tonight, I'll see you next Thursday for the Academicals game.'' 
 
 There was a sudden flash of light and sharp thud, like someone had popped a balloon, but in reverse. It had come from where one of the Librarians had shuffle down an aisle. `` What was that?'' asked a startled Camille. 
 
 `` That was one of the Librarians returning to their Library.'' Responded Jerry. There were two other flashes and thuds in succession, from different parts of the library. Camille watched the short lumpy Librarian wander down the fiction aisle labelled'P', which was soon after followed by a flash and thud. 
 
 Camille dashed around the corner. There was no one there. Ignoring Jerry's cries, she hurried around the rest of the library, not finding anyone even though no one had left through the locked entrances. 
 
 She came back to Jerry. `` Jerry, what is going on?!'' 
 
 `` Camille, have a seat.'' Both she and Jerry did. `` You've heard of the phrase,'Knowledge is Power?''' 
 
 `` Yeah.'' 
 
 `` Well, that's more true than we thought. Knowledge truly is power. That power can be converted into energy. Einstein was on the right track with his equations, but forgot to take human thought into it. With a little tweaking, we can understand that the knowledge that comes from a library can generate energy, which can be harnessed into mass, which can affect space and time. In essence, the library is one of the most technologically advanced places on earth.'' 
 
 Camille looked utterly bewildered. `` I do n't understand.'' 
 
 `` That's okay, I did n't at first either. Let me just tell you this then: Libraries are places of power, and Librarians can harness that power. We can use it to travel all over the world, if we wanted to! All the libraries are connected to each other through this power, L-space, wormholes, whatever you want to call it. Here, take my hand.'' 
 
 Camille hesitated. Then, gingerly, she placed her hand in his. With a flash and a Thud, their surroundings changed. The shelves here were taller, the books older, the aisles narrower. 
 
 `` We are at Oxford College. Take a look around.'' 
 
 Camille slowly edged her way towards the end of the aisle and looked down. This was definitely a different place, and it was always what she imagined Oxford to look like. She gave out a shriek and ran back to Jerry. `` What is going on!?'' 
 
 `` I told you, Librarians can travel between libraries. And I just took you to one of the most famous libraries in England. But we can go back now.'' Before Camille had time to protest, Jerry laid a hand on her shoulder and they were back in their home Library. 
 
 `` Do n't do that again without asking me first.'' Camille felt slightly dizzy. 
 
 `` Okay, I wo n't.'' Jerry smiled. `` Listen. I know this is a lot to take in, but this is important stuff. You have been selected to be a member of the Librarians, to be trained in this awesome power. And I am going to teach you it.'' 
 
 Camille took a seat and looked at her feet. `` I'm not really sure I'm ready for this. This is just too much.'' 
 
 Jerry nodded. `` I understand. But, what if I told you that we can travel to any book you wanted too?'' 
 
 Camille looked up. `` What do you mean?'' she asked, narrowing her eyes. 
 
 `` I mean,'' said Jerry, grinning, `` that books are not just made up stories, but portals to other worlds. Would you like to visit them?'' 
 
 Camille thought this over. `` Maybe one, but that does n't mean I want to actually be a part of this!'' 
 
 Jerry held up his hand defensively. `` I wo n't force you to do anything you do n't want to do. But come with me and we can go inside any book. Maybe I'll even show you which story I'm originally from.'' 
 
 `` Wait, you're not from this world?'' 
 
 `` Maybe.'' Jerry said with a twinkle in his eye. `` But right now, it's time for you to pick a book.'' 
 
 `` Which one? I mean, how do I choose?'' 
 
 Jerry shrugged. `` That's up to you. Preferably something before the 1920's because copyright is tricky.'' 
 
 `` Huh?'' 
 
 `` Librarian joke. Come on, where are we going?'' 
 
 Camille gazed across the library, eyeing each shelf with a new sense of wonder. After a moment, she grabbed Jerry's hand and pulled him down the long hallway. `` I know just the one.''
",Rewrite the story with a different focus on different energy usage,"Camille pulled up to the library and parked around the back, next to a dull red Corolla. She double checked the text to make sure she had read everything right.

It read: Camille, I need you to come to the library RIGHT NOW. I'll explain everything later. Jeremiah.

Jerry was n't one to send dramatic messages in the middle of the night like this, so obviously it was important. Hopefully this was n't some romantic gesture. She had always guessed that maybe he had feelings for her over the past few years, but she made sure to let him know that she was taken.

She jogged through the light rain and unlocked the back door. She carefully hung up her coat in the staff lounge and called out, `` Jerry, I'm here!''

``Camille,'' came Jerry's voice back. `` Come out to the main hall, will you?''

`` Sure thing.'' The library was still on partial power for the night, but Camille carefully managed her way out into the hall in the half light. It was considerably brighter out here, far brighter than it should have been. Ahead of her there were numerous candles, some on tables, on top of piles of books, and a few candlesticks - the tall ones used for the cities Hanukkah display. Standing in the middle of the half circle of candles, wearing a ridiculous purple robe lined with silver trimming, stood a smiling Jerry.

``Camille, do n't worry,'' he said extending his hand. `` Come over here please.''

This was a romantic gesture. It was odd, but so was Jerry. This was so awkward, Camille could feel her cheeks flush with embarrassment.

`` Oh, Jerry, I...'' It was at that moment that Camille realized they were not alone. One the open end of the half circle of candles were three tall slender figures - and one short lumpy one. They stood elevated on a dais - the one that was used for the Spring Choir Festival. She could not see their faces, as they were wearing the same ridiculous robes that Jerry was wearing only with their hoods up.

Something in the energy usage of the library was off. The lights were far too bright, far brighter than they should have been. The candles were unnecessary, adding unnecessary heat and smoke to the air. The air conditioning was on full blast, attempting to cool down the excessive heat generated by the candles and lights.",uoBXXdHvQt

 John Royles was a simple man. He took strolls along the sewers nightly. But one night, there was some construction. Construction happened every few months to block off the rising tides of the sewers, ever since... *he shudders just thinking about it*... the flood. His whole family had been wiped out. All except his older brother Joseph. 
 
 That was 10 years ago. He had to stop thinking about it, and move on, his therapist said. But, he could n't. His mind could n't get rid of the screaming, the terror that flew through his mind as he hung onto that one small rusty ladder leading to the surface. The water rushing by his face. Then, just like that. It all stopped. The thoughts of death fell apart in his mind as it all went quiet. There was nothing.

John Royles sat on the cold steel steps of his meager home, a stark contrast to the bright, colorful artwork that adorned the walls of his room. His brother Joseph's presence echoed in the rustle of the water rushing past the sewer grate near his feet. Their bond had been forged amidst the tragedy that had swept away their family, a tragedy that John suppressed deeply yet clung to the memory of like a suffocating shroud.

The construction that had once disrupted his nightly stroll along the sewers had ceased just a few months prior. It had felt like a fleeting moment of peace amidst the storm of loss that had swallowed him. But the silence that had once been unsettling had morphed into a profound solitude, a mirror reflecting the emptiness of his life.

A memory surfaced again, vivid and terrifying: the flood, the screams of his family, the helplessness of clinging to a single rusty ladder against the surging tide. The water rushed past his face, the terror",

,"The first group of humans arrived at the distant planet officially named E2-70042, but affectionately nicknamed Earth 2 by the vast majority of society. The planet, just over one light year away was deemed to be a plausible destination back in 2016, after a group of scientists from the United States, Russia, France, and Australia formed a joint commission to study space exploration. The planet, ironically, rests roughly 93 million miles away from its very own star, and has an oxygen rich atmosphere, much like Earth. 
 
 In 2018 Presidents Putin and Trump drafted a team comprised of a few top scientists, and experienced astronauts to complete a journey to this planet. Using a new breakthrough in fuel cells, a ship was designed to travel around a third of the speed of light, making the trip to Earth 2, a feasible 4 year journey. 
 
 The world rejoiced in patriotism as the brave crew set out to be the first humans to set foot onto an alien planet. A place that could one day become a new home. 
 
 As the giant rocket launched, people from all over were glued to their television, computer, and phone screens to see this once in history event. Everything went off without a hitch. As the ship breached Earth ’ s atmosphere, Presidents Putin and Trump held a joint address to the world, speaking about how the events of the past couple of years had seemed to force the two countries to become powerful allies, and without those events, this project would have never come to fruition. 
 
 As the ship coasted further away from the gravitational pull of Earth, Captain Frank Proper, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA announced to the crew that they were able to move freely about the ship, but would be transitioning into deep space travel in one hour. 
 
 Dr. Boris Sokolov, from St. Petersburg, Russia, was relived, and immediately released his seatbelt. He longed to be able to stretch out his legs after being strapped to his seat all day in preparation of the launch. This was his second time in space, after previously coming up to perform some diagnostic and repair work on the space station. He took delight in the way the lack of gravity made his hair feel. 
 
 Dr. Sokolov and Captain Proper became fast friends during the training phases, and often sat up late at night drinking coffee and sharing old hunting stories. On the night before the launch, the two had visited until nearly midnight, drinking a pot of decaffeinated Folgers and listening to “ Space Oddity ”. 
 
 Sargent Dianna Walker, from Arlington Virginia, USA, was a lifelong member of the Air Force, joining ROTC in the 7th grade, and taking every opportunity she could to be involved with the military until she could enlist, as she did, at the age of 17 with parental consent. She attended training right in Arlington, and quickly climbed the ranks through flight school. She was the first woman to pilot a ship into space with a multinational crew. She did not choose to wander about the ship; instead, she stayed in her seat and ran tests on the equipment. She was chosen largely for her unwavering dedication to her mission ’ s success. 
 
 Dr. Douglas Smith, a Canadian native, moved to Seattle, Washington at age 16, and became a citizen of the United States at 18. He was accepted to MIT at 21 years of age, and finished his doctoral degree in physics and astrophysics at 27. This was Dr. Smith ’ s first trip into space, something he had looked forward to since he was a child. He immediately went to the nearest window and stared out into the darkness, in awe of the vastness. 
 
 Captain Yousef Ivanov, also from St. Petersburg had been chosen by President Putin personally for this trip due to his display of patriotism, and his extensive work in engineering and rocket science. His work contributed to the creation of the new fuel cell that would power their trip. 
 
 This small crew would be sharing close quarters for the next four years while they travel to their destination on Earth 2. Although there had been advances in cryogenic technology, the reanimation process had not been successful at this point, so the crew would be placed into medically induced comas for three months at a time, in shifts. This would not only conserve resources, but would make the trip seem much shorter to the crew. 
 
 Once the ship reached optimal speeds, and the tests were ran, the first half of the crew went into the sleep chambers. The awake crew manned the controls, and monitored the ships systems. Every several thousand miles, the ship would launch a couple of probes that would remain stationary, and communicate. The idea behind this was to build a bridge of communication back to earth, much like signal boosters, so that the crew would be able to speak to command from Earth 2, despite a large delay. 
 
 Three years and one hundred eighty five days passed without incident. The crew had remained in communication with Earth, finding that with the probes assisting communication, they could get communication back to Earth in as little as one year, nearly twice as fast as anticipated. 
 
 They were within five hundred thousand miles of Earth 2, and the entire crew was awake, and anxious. They could see in the distance, the blue-green hue of the new planet, growing closer by the minute. Sargent Walker ’ s eyes remained fixed on the target, her steel-like appearance unwaivered by the frenzy of emotions raging within her. 
 
 “ Prepare for landing ”, Captain Proper called out to the crew. “ Home, this is USS Patriot phoning home for the last time before making contact. I really wish more of you could see what I ’ m seeing now. She ’ s so vivid. So very blue and green. In my life, there has been a lot of talking, a lot of simulations, and a lot of video games where I have roamed foreign planets, but nothing could have prepared me for this. ” 
 
 “ Captain, ” called Dr. Smith, “ We ’ re leaking fuel. ” Smith ’ s voice had brought the mood of the crew immediately to a low point. 
 “ How, Smith? ” The Captain replied. 
 
 “ It has to be one of the seals. Maybe it froze, it ’ s had to say but the levels are dropping fast. ” 
 
 “ Switch to secondary fuel, and stop the flow to the primary! ” Sokolov interjected. 
 
 “ Already done ”, said Walker, as she worked her fingers along the control board. “ We ’ re coming into the gravitational pull of Earth 2 now. We won ’ t need much to get us down. ” 
 
 Despite the fuel setback, Walker successfully piloted the ship into the atmosphere of the planet, and safely landed it on what appeared to be a salt flat in the southern hemisphere of the planet. The scare was over when the ship finally came to a stop and the crew stared in awe at the surroundings through the windows. The planet appeared uninhabited, and completely untouched. In the distance, they saw alien vegetation that was not so different from that on Earth. There were grass and trees of a deep green. They could see snow dusting the tops of mountainous peaks on the horizon. 
 
 “ Pardon my language, but this is fucking fantastic! ” cried Sokolov. 
 
 The crew roamed about the craft performing diagnostics on the ship. Dr. Smith began the ships automated sample collection, testing the air and soil, analyzing it. This continued for several days, with the crew discovering that the fuel leak was caused by a stuck injection flap in the engine. 
 
 The leak was far greater than they had thought, and now faced the crisis of how to get home. Smith found that the atmosphere was nearly identical to that on Earth, consisting of slightly more oxygen, and less carbon dioxide. It was, however, able to support life. The crew was exited at the thought of being able to go outside onto this new planet without protective gear. They would be able to feel the wind touch their faces, and feel the soil on their skin.

 The human pulled off a shining metal helmet and flung its golden locks back. Even in the pale torch light of my caverns it seemed to reflect the color of my coins. 
 `` You have in your possession a small token of great esteem for my native lands. To you it is a trivial little ring of brass but to me It is much more valuable. I wish to bargain for it.'' The human said in a confident but respectful tone. Normally when adventurers make their way into my sanctum they come in groups, set traps, and blather on and on about righteousness. It is exceedingly rare to to find one a cut above the rest. 
 `` What makes this ring valuable to yourself more than me?'' I asked with some mild curiosity. 
 `` It is a magical ring that when worn can transform you into what I desire most. You are too large to use such a trinket.'' The human reasoned. 
 `` Interesting...'' I mused. `` What value in such a thing, what could you possibly offer in exchange for a magical ring?'' 
 `` I am not a noble nor royal but anything that you desire that I can produce will be yours.'' The human said sitting crossed legged below my alter. Again its hair struck my eyes, long and golden obviously groomed for many years and kept free of tangles, blades, and briars. 
 `` I desire but one thing. Cut your golden locks and add them to my hold. For the love you have shown them and your vanity being struck would bring me more joy than any amount of gold your paltry life could gather.'' I do admit that being wicked to the race of man is particularly rewarding. They do scurry and war over such trivial things and believe that they are superior to all other creatures. It is a treasure in its own to knock them down a peg or two. 
 The human pulled its hair for a moment, obviously taken back by the strange request. With no more than that moment of hesitation a small silver blade came out and in moments the long golden locks lay lifeless upon my hold. A moment of disappointment filled me. Obviously a magic ring is worth far more than hair but I had hoped for some moments of pain or anguish over loosing something you have taken pride on. 
 `` Very well mortal. If you can find your ring in this massive hold then you can use it.'' I mumbled moving slightly away from the hold. I must admit in my old age I have forgotten where every individual item has settled in my hold. 
 The human took out a small scroll and read from it words that were foreign to me. I heard the rustle of gold coins and a small brass ring with a ruby set upon it levitated out of the horde and into the air. Now was my chance. 
 Quickly i began to transform into the form that I have avoided when possible. A tall slender black haired main with pale skin and long red robes. I snatched the ring out of the air and landed softly before the warrior. 
 `` You can use it once I have taken my turn.'' I cackled. Slipping the ring on I immediately meditated on my own form, scales stronger than ever, breath hotter with teeth and claws sharper and longer than before yet years reset to that of young adulthood. I could feel the rings energy flowing through me and I closed my eyes. I felt my body rippling and strengthening... stiffening? 
 In horror I opened my eyes to see my body slowly changing into gold, from foot up it climbed. I quickly attempted to pull the ring off but my arms were already growing heavy and stiff. I looked to the human with such rage. 
 `` What is this sorcery! I should have known not to trust a human.'' I sputtered. Already my lungs were stiffening and breath was becoming shallow. 
 `` There was no deception on my part wyrm. It is transforming you into what I want the most. A golden statue of a handsome man will go nicely in my new castle. You should pay more attention to grammar and syntax.'' 
 The final moments of a thousand years was to see the face of that dreadful women smiling in the torchlight.
",Rewrite the prompt set in a futuristic cyberpunk world,"In the neon-lit streets of a futuristic cyberpunk metropolis, I stood guard, my senses heightened. The air was thick with the scent of ozone and desperation. A human, adorned in a gleaming metal helmet and sporting golden locks, approached me. I felt a sense of foreboding as their eyes locked with mine.

""I'm listening, mortal..."" I announced, my voice echoing through the cavernous space. The human removed their helmet, revealing a glimmering smile and a confident air. They presented me with a small token of great esteem, a brass ring that shimmered under the dim light.

""You have in your possession a small token of great esteem for my native lands,"" the human said, their voice laced with a mix of respect and entitlement. ""To you, it is a trivial little ring, but to me, it is much more valuable. I wish to bargain for it.""

I was curious about the ring's significance. ""What makes this ring valuable to yourself more than me?"" I asked, my voice dripping with doubt.

""It is a magical ring that when worn can transform you into what I desire most,"" the human reasoned. ""You are too large to use such a trinket.""

I listened intently, my mind swirling with thoughts. ""Interesting..."" I murmured, my tone laced with a hint of admiration. ""What value in such a thing, what could you possibly offer in exchange for a magical ring?""

The human sat crossed legged below me, their eyes gleaming. ""I am not a noble nor royal, but anything that you desire that I can produce will be yours,"" they declared.

I had a desire, a craving for destruction. I knew that humans were prone to petty squabbles and delusions of superiority. It was a pleasure to manipulate their vanity and bring them low.

As the human hesitated, I seized the opportunity. A silver blade emerged from my sheath, and with swiftness, I cut their golden locks, adding them to my hold. The human screamed in pain and terror. As they stumbled back, I felt a sense of satisfaction knowing that I had bested yet another human, and the world was a little more balanced.",qZWpQdHkEc

,"The convoy raced across the surface of Groom Lake towards the smoke cloud in the distance. Ambassador Muffley adjusted his tie and nervously looked at the burly ex-military men flanking him in the uparmored Explorer's seats. 
 
 First contact. 
 
 Muffley had felt somewhat let down when the President had assigned him this particular ambassadorship. `` The quiet neighbors'' as they had come to be called did n't require a lot of statesmanship. Since they had pulled their planet alongside earth they had been remarkably quiet. In fact, they were great neighbors in many ways. They salvaged space junk constantly, had managed to scrub a great deal of CO2 from Earth's atmosphere ( it was widely believed the used it for energy ) and sent a message once a year in several hundred languages that espoused that they meant the earth no harm. They picked a different holiday to send this message every year and no matter how many messages were sent in return, no one had ever received a reply. 
 
 Before today most of Muffley's job had simply been convincing other states not to blow the suspicious planet out of the cosmos. Some states were distrustful of the lack of communication, especially in the first two years. China had promised to shoot anything down that entered Earth's atmosphere and North Korea had unsuccessfully fired several dozen nuclear warheads into the sky. 
 
 But not today! Today was the day Ambassador Muffley was to make world history. He adjusted his toupe as they sped towards the crash site. A ship had crashed and drones overhead reported seeing two bipedal creatures walking upright away from the wreckage. 
 
 The smoke curled around the sides of the Explorer as it slowed to a halt. The doors swung open and both of the armed guards dismounted and stood behind the doors as planned. Muffley followed suit and stepped onto the dry lakebed. 
 
 Four large black eyes like saucers greeted him. The creatures were bipedal, grey, and hairless. The both waved pleasantly. 
 
 `` Greetings visitors... err... neighbors'' Muffley stammered. 
 
 Muffley heard a voice that seemed to come from inside his head. The rumors of telepathy must have been true. 
 
 `` Greetings. Ambassador Muffley. We mean you no harm, nor earth any harm. I am Captain Gorp.We were on an important mission from our planet and require your assistance. We meant to land at your installation, as you have a great number of antennae and other surveillance equipment there and we assumed many great minds were here that could help us with our needs. Unfortunately, our ship was not prepared for the change in atmosphere and struck a rather large particle on the way down.'' 
 
 Muffley looked at the ship and noticed the rather large carcass of a hawk was wedged in the canopy. Muffley nodded and in his most statesmen like voice spoke to the creatures: 
 
 `` Captain Gorp. I hope this is an okay way of addressing you and speaking. I sincerely apologize for the trouble you had in landing and can assure you that we will assist your planet so that we may develop a friendly and mutually beneficial relationship. What is the problem?'' 
 
 Gorp responded `` Ambassador Muffley, our people have learned to enjoy signals from your planet a great deal, our people have great emotional attachment to them. In the past, we had to wait many months for these signals, this was our original reason for moving our planets closer. Today however, we prepared to receive one of our favorite signals, and it cut out as we began to receive it. We need to know the contents of this signal. Our planet is discontent.'' 
 
 `` You must be referring to SETI, they send you hundreds of messages daily. I do n't know why you did n't receive them...'' Muffley was immediately cut off but the voice that seemed inside himself. 
 
 `` No Ambassador... not the spam from your government. We are referring to the signal known as `` Game of Thrones'' we must know the fate of the human known as Jon Snow!'' 
 
 Muffley tapped his foot impatiently. He felt horribly miffed for the second time in his life. 
 
 `` So your cable is out... that's it....I think I have it TiVo'ed I can gt your planet a recording.'' 
 
 Captain Gorp's expression did n't change, but his eyes turned to a pale blue. He nodded and `` spoke.'' 
 
 `` Muffley you will be a hero to our people for centuries to come!'' 
 
 `` I'm glad to be of service... is there anything else you want to ask?'' 
 
 Captain Grop shuffled and looked at his feet. 
 
 `` Ambassador, if it is n't too much to ask... we also need a cup of sugar... please.'' 
 
 `` Neighbors... they are the same everywhere'' Muffley thought to himself.

There was one soldier who was in charge of everything. He was tall and had a lot of hair. He was wearing a suit and a tie. He looked like he was nervous. He was probably thinking about what he was going to do next.

When the soldiers got to the crash site, they started walking around. They found two big creatures. They were walking upright and looked like they could talk. They had big black eyes and were grey and hairless. They waved at the soldiers.

The soldiers were scared at first, but they eventually calmed down. They started talking to the creatures. They learned that the creatures were peaceful and wanted to help.

,"`` The Crime That Killed Humanity,'' it was called. When they discovered the Fountain of Youth. Sure, Ponce de Leon found it first. But we did n't know that until a crazy billionaire that was convinced that the Fountain existed staged a silly expedition into the middle of nowhere in Florida. 
 
 There, he found the bones. What we used to know is that Ponce de Leon gave up the search and decided to keep on gallivanting around the world. What we now know is that there were a few men he left behind to guard his discovery. Turns out that when the discovery of the century was made, he was told off for searching for something that was n't gold or of benefit to the Spanish Crown. So off he went, leaving a few men to guard the Fountain. There, they kept their promise, drinking the water. And when we found what was left of them, then we did n't believe them. Even though we encountered something that was life-restoring, but we did n't believe anything they wrote on whatever they could write on - rocks, trees, their armor and clothing. All in Spanish. Curses in Spanish, pleading of God to end their suffering. We did n't know why they wrote it. Only that they showed remorse for having indulged in living. We ignored the warnings, and we paid the price. 
 
 The Fountain of Youth was opened a few years later. The crazy billionaire flaunted it, drinking it in public, saying that the Fountain was going to make America great again. He was n't wrong. Those who drank the stuff had their wounds healed, their vision restored. Muscle dystrophy was treated, cancer was done in, the blind regained their vision, the deaf their hearing, it was a miracle - the water healed everything that was n't right. The religious were chanting how the Fountain was their gift from God ( as was he, chugging bottles of it and then cutting himself just to show how the water healed him ), atheists were baffled, scientific experiments were conducted to find out why the water healed. 
 
 That's where science decided to keep quiet. I'm not sure why, only that it did. 
 
 The Fountain of Youth was never empty. In fact, it was very badly overcrowded. Each time an expansion was commissioned, the Fountain never underscored in attendance. The hardest part of expansion was how fiercely the local wildlife protected it - almost zealously, without giving up. But as soon as the expansion was made, up to a certain point, the wildlife gave up. Whatever animals were captured fought against their captors, baring teeth, claws, rabid. But after a few days they stopped. They reverted to their average behavior. The parrots, instead of shrieking and flying everywhere, resumed their calm melodies and mocking tones of the zookeepers. The crocodiles were crocodiles. Everything was fine with them after a week of drinking non-youth water. 
 
 The water was akin to a drug in how the body handled the it. First it released a huge amount of dopamine. Then adrenaline. Then it healed any wounds or afflictions. And then it went straight to the bladder within five minutes. That was the concentrated mix, derived straight from the fountain and had flavors added. The consumer version was diluted twentyfold, but was half as effective as the concentrate. But it was tastier, considering how many flavors could be added to it. Health-Juice was monopolized world-wide. And hence why only one company was ever blamed for the genocide. Not like the company exists now to keep taking the blame like a champ. 
 
 They say, by the time seven years have passed, that all cells from seven years ago are gone and have been replaced with newer versions within your body. The water that was left within your body after you drank it left some minor healing effects, that much was apparent. 
 
 Then the Fountain ran dry, five years later. By that time, five hundred billion consumer bottles have been sold. Considering that the consumer version was diluted twentyfold. The company was rich, the billionaire was rich, most investors were rich. And everyone was chugging the stuff. Those that did n't chug right away set up stockpiles. When the Fountain ran dry, there was a rapid spike in prices - each bottle, instead of costing ten bucks, cost two hundred. Assuming that the bottles were n't tampered with and then diluted even further until the water's healing effects were on par with the body's own regeneration. 
 
 The well ran dry not because of overconsumption, but because the water's effects were adjusted by the body. After six months of drinking one bottle a day to heal a bone that was being broken continuously, five bottles were needed to do the same job per day. After another six months, two tonnes of the stuff was needed to heal anything per day. The madness and the quest for eternal youth never stopped. 
 
 By 2027, humanity was dead. Because of the body's adjusted healing effects, the water became unnecessary. One could make do like Deadpool and heal any injury. 
 
 Five years after drinking the last drop ( for the average human ), the healing effects stopped for most people. In fact, due to the immune system's new state of being obsolete, the body rejected it. The water's adding effects did the job better. And then the healing ran out. Wounds that could heal within seconds festered. Bones did n't heal. Those who regained vision and hearing kept their senses, but were n't so different from the rest of humanity when everyone shared a festering gangrene papercut. 
 
 Whoever did n't stop healing within five years stopped within six. Those who stockpiled their shares were often robbed for it. 
 
 Vaccines, by virtue of not being needed, killed whoever was injected with them. Humanity could n't do anything, not even the weakest of injections. Because even the tiniest virus could undo everything. 
 
 Viruses never go away. Even in the body, they remain dormant while waiting for the right conditions to start the incubation period. And then they strike. 
 
 That's what happened. The common rhinovirus, a common little cold, something everybody shared... killed humanity. Few people survived, and only because they were careful to watch their steps. I watched mine. I knew where we were heading. Accelerated healing and youth have a terrible price. A price I never cared to pay. I watched most people I know die, but I did n't care because of how delusional they were, thinking there was no catch to endless healing, tasty water, and eternal youth. I only had a few bottles in my entire life - one to get me up on my legs from the wheelchair that plagued me for twenty years, one to heal my poor eyes, and another for alcohol poisoning. All within four years. Not like I care. I can do what I like, now that no one's here. 
 
 Now that I think about it, I know why we never weaned off the water. We liked health too much to think about giving up a little bit of living just to experience invulnerability from the common cold.
",Rewrite the story from the perspective of the fountain.,"As a fountain, I have witnessed countless travelers and stories. The Tale of ""The Crime That Killed Humanity"" is one that echoes through my waters, a tale of discovery, remorse, and healing.

When Ponce de Leon stumbled upon me, my waters flowed with the promise of everlasting life. Yet, fate took a cruel turn as he abandoned his search for immortality and left behind a few men to guard my treasure. Their presence was a testament to their unwavering determination to protect the secret of youth.

As the years went by, my waters were discovered by a visionary entrepreneur who believed in my transformative power. He flaunted my bounty, claiming that I would make America great again. And it was true. Those who partook of my elixir found solace in their wounds being healed, their sight restored, and their bodies made whole. The blind regained their vision, the deaf regained their hearing, and the sick found relief from their ailments.

However, their joy was short-lived. As the intoxicating effects of my waters faded, remorse crept back into their hearts. They penned their fears and regrets on any surface they could find, cursing their fate and pleading for relief. Their writings were a testament to the fleeting nature of youth and the profound impact of unchecked indulgence.

In the face of their pleas, I remained unmoved. I knew that my power was a gift, a blessing and a curse. It was a gift that could bring joy and healing, but also one that could lead to self-destruction. I had seen the best and worst of humanity, and I knew that the true power of youth lay in moderation and wisdom.

So, I continue to flow, offering the elixir of life to all who come my way. But I also urge caution, reminding my visitors that the true treasure lies not in the pursuit of immortality but in the pursuit of a balanced and fulfilling life.",XzDUbKDeiW
,"“ Who ’ s a good girl! 
 Whoooo ’ s a good girl! ” 
 “ Muuurtt! Meorw! ” 
 “ That ’ s right YOU are! ” I loudly proclaim, ruffling my feline companions fur as she lolled around on my lap, basking in her glory. Pebbles purr rumbled powerfully as she rolled this way and that, nearly falling off my lap twice after arching her back for more back rubs. I could recognize the signs. Sometimes cats reached a state of too-much-happy before a switch flipped in their brain and they went nuts. And she was at her apex of happy. Before I knew it, Pebbles had my hand clasped in her paws and she was chewing on my fingers as if she never had a meal. 
 
 “ Ouch! ” I said, wincing as her sharp canines dug into my flesh. “ Ok, that ’ s enough attention for now. ” Flipping over, the little calico looked to the carpet and sprang down but not before getting one last back stroke. A stroke that apparently tugged a little too hard on her tail due to her angle of trajectory. 
 
 A sharp yowl pierced the air as she darted a few steps away from me. Christ, did I pull that hard? 
 
 “ Oh hon, I ’ m sorry! ” 
 
 The sincere apology was not enough to spare me from an accusatory glare. 
 
 “ Really I didn ’ t mean to do that! ” My tone took a soft turn as I closed my eyes half way, trying to communicate in Cateese that I wasn ’ t a threat. All I received was a tail tip twitch. *Sigh*. How normal. 
 
 What wasn ’ t normal was the subsequent *pic-CHINCK* noise that emanated from my cat ’ s rump. Confusion melted into horror as I witnessed my beloved felines backside peeling open; her tail slowly lifting toward her spine, twitching angrily as it went, as her miniature tush hydraulics kicked in with an audible ‘ hhhhhsssssss ’. 
 
 The silence that followed was deafening but ended when my ape like emotional response kicked in. 
 
 “ What the FUCK? ” I exclaimed, flinging my arms wildly outward as a blur of fur dashed from the room, her hydraulics hissing with each spring and gradually fading into the bedroom. As she most certainly cowed under the bed, I remain paralyzed on the sofa, trying to rationalize what the hell I just saw. Cat butts do not separate from cats. Cat butts are cat butts. They stay put. They product foul smelly things I ’ m forced to scoop out of dirty kitty boxes. But they do not lift away from the body. Am I dreaming? *pinch* No. Drunk? Not unless Pebbles spiked my drink. I needed to investigate this further. 
 
 Like usual, she was cowering under the bed, well out of my reach. It took much coaxing, pleading, three scratches to my hand, and six cat treats before I could extract her for examination. Setting her on the bed and pacifying her with more goodies, I leaned over see a port buried into her bum. Well, not her technical bum. Hell, the port appeared to be in the same plane as her butt, so how was she even going to the… 
 
 Oh god, never mind. Sometimes details aren ’ t necessary. 
 
 Gripping her gently in my arms, I hauled her over to the computer to look at the ports configuration. Oddly it ’ s a USB. How did this get installed on my cat without my knowledge? Was there some mad scientist out there performing cruel experiments on cats? How did this fly past the Humane Society? Were cats even real? Robots? Rubbing my eyes in bewilderment, I felt a fuzzy paw press into my stomach. 
 
 “ Meorw? ” 
 
 My green eyes met her amber ones and I could sense she wanted more treats. As I obliged, I reached for a USB cable to commit the unthinkable: plugging it into my cat ’ s hinny. Pebbles didn ’ t seem fazed in the slightest as I angled the device at her nethers then slid it into place. God I felt like I just violated the poor animal despite her having zero raction. Clutching the other end of the cable, a thought hit me. 
 
 If this is real, what if she has viruses? I glanced wryly at her, pondering if that might be a reason she occasionally pees on my rug. Hmm. Not chancing it. 
 
 Quickly I boot the computer into safe mode then plug her in. Before I could launch AVG and CCleaner, a popup automatically displayed on the monitor. 
 
 “ Welcome to F.E.L.I.N.E. Model KT1000 
 Your current feline version is out of date. 
 Your Cat Version: 1.0.0. 
 Current Update 256.3 
 Would you like to update now? ” 
 
 I blinked a few times. My cat… has an update? I glanced at Pebbles, who seemed to be eyeing the bag of salmon flavored nuggets again, then back to the screen. Well before I did that, perhaps I ’ ll run the virus checker first. Might as well be safe, right? It took nearly two hours to come back with results: 
 
 FeH1N5 
 
 FeLV-II 
 
 That ’ s… odd. She had her vaccinations as a kitten and was indoor only. How on earth did she get Feline Leukemia? 
 
 *How on earth did she get a port in her butt? * My brain promptly thought. 
 
 Mentally I shrugged and hit the button to isolate the virus. IF it would isolate it. To my surprise it did. Hovering my mouse pointer over the ‘ upgrade now ’ button, I gave my girl a quick pat of assurance then braced for, well, who knows what? 
 
 At first Pebbles sat on the desk watching me, her ears flicking back and forth as the update bar very slowly progressed. But about a quarter of the way through, she suddenly stiffened. Instantly I shot to attention, watching as my poor baby fell over and began seizing horribly. 
 
 “ PEBBLES?? ” I screeched, instantly pulling her into my lap as her tiny body tremored fiercely. “ Oh no! No, no, no, no, no! ” My eyes flew to the process bar, it ’ s updates loading faster and faster as I scrambled at the mouse. My hand shot to the ‘ cancel ’ button and frantically clicked to terminate the update all together. This wasn ’ t worth my cat ’ s life! Why did I DO this? What *idiocy* prompted me to do this to my cat? 
 
 Suddenly I took notice of how heavy she had become. Her once 8-pound frame had burgeoned twice her size. Her black and orange spots seemed more vibrant than before, with a strange alluring shimmer, while the texture of her fur rivaled that of the softest rabbit. Her body tremors eventually subsided, and I sat aghast at what transpired as I stroked her head and whispered, “ Please be okay! Please! ” 
 
 Bordering on tears, my tummy felt the comforting sensation of two paws making biscuits before a voice filtered into my head. 
 
 “ I ’ m okay. ” 
 
 Confused, I reel back in my chair as Pebbles lifted her head to gaze at me. Her eyes were no longer pure amber but a mix of gold, orange, and reds that swirled around in a hypnotic manner. 
 
 “ Thank you. You have cured me but, please, I need your help. *We* need your help. Or they will kill us all. ”

 "" Muuurtt! Meorw! ""
 "" That ’ s right YOU are! "" I loudly proclaim, ruffling my dishwasher’s chrome exterior as it rattled and vibrated, washing the dishes as if possessed. As it spun and churned, the dishes danced and splashed, nearly falling from the racks twice after arching its back for more attention. I could recognize the signs. Sometimes appliances reached a state of too-much-happy before a switch flipped in their brain and they went nuts. And it was at its apex of happy. Before I knew it, the dishwasher had me trapped in its swirling vortex and I was being pummeled against the side of the machine as if it had never had a meal. 

 "" Ouch! "" I said, wincing as the sharp metal teeth of the dishwasher dug into my flesh. "" Ok, that ’ s enough attention for now.

486.0,"I hammered away at the keyboard, enemy snipers picking off my team one by one. My teammates weren ’ t exactly doing much either, running straight back out from behind cover. I was getting sick and tired of losing every match, so I enabled a few console commands. 
 
 For you non-PC Elite master race gamers, console commands are the shit. Cheat codes for consoles are nowhere near as cool. The possibilities are endless – only limited by your imagination. Your enemy way too skilled? Have a pig appear in his crosshairs every time he tries to shoot. Or better yet, make him shoot out bullets that don ’ t hurt. Their reactions when they get five clean shots on you, and you don ’ t die… priceless. 
 
 My computer decided to choose that moment to freeze, and to say I was pissed would be an understatement. I was seething. I grabbed the keyboard and like a true raging idiot, I threw it at the monitor. Sparks flew out, one of them catching me just under the temple. 
 
 By this point, my “ babysitter ” had burst into the room, finally eager to give me",Rewrite the story with a third person POV and add suspenseful atmosphere,"In the heat of battle, the gamer's fingers danced across the keyboard, a symphony of fury and desperation. Enemy snipers picked off his team, one by one, as the tension mounted and the atmosphere suffocated the room. The gamer's teammates, unwilling to engage, retreated hastily behind cover, leaving the gamer to battle alone.

Frustration boiled within the gamer as defeat became a constant companion. In a desperate attempt to turn the tide of battle, he went deeper into the depths of the console commands, unleashing a arsenal of cheats that would make even the most seasoned gamer weep. With a sprinkle of mayhem and a sprinkle of mischief, he devised a plan to turn the tables on his opponents.

A sudden freeze of the computer cast a cold sweat down the gamer's brow. The game paused, but the suspense remained. In a fit of anger, he grabbed the keyboard and hurled it against the monitor, a display of sheer rage and frustration. Sparks danced across the room",
,"The first time I was summoned, my daughter was 5 and she found a spider in the bathroom. I was downstairs reading when I heard a crackling, like electricity, and then a loud pop as I appeared in the bathroom upstairs, falling hard on my tailbone. 
 
 Being summoned while sleeping was the worst though. We talked it through many times, but she still got scared. What was I to do though? She was only five and the dark still scared her. To be honest, I think the dark still scares most adults too. 
 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 
 
 The first time I faced an owlbear, she was 13. I appeared in between her and the owlbear, but the first thing I noticed actually was the elf boy hiding behind a tree. 
 
 “ Were you out here with him?! ” I asked, a bit more upset-sounding than I actually meant it to be. 
 
 “ Uh, mom, can we talk about this later? Like, owlbear…behind you? Big teeth? ” 
 I didn ’ t actually know what to do about the owlbear, so I decided to follow the general suggestions for any animal interaction: look big and menacing and hope they go away. 
 
 I turned to the owlbear, raised to my tiptoes, pointed a finger and in my best mom voice said, “ and as for you, mister! You go back to your cave! I ’ m dealing with a teenager right now, and so help me Hades I will ruin your day too if you don ’ t leave right this instant! ” 
 
 Mom-speak is a language that spans all species. That owlbear immediately looked at my daughter, slunk its head, turned, and lumbered off back into the forest. 
 
 “ What ’ s his name? ” I asked, turning and looking towards the elven boy. 
 
 “ Lorelian, ” she said, “ we have several classes together. We were out looking for lamb ’ s ear. ” 
 
 “ Class, huh? Look Maddie, you can ’ t just go wandering out into the forest alone. I don ’ t care if you ’ re looking for lamb ’ s ear or Lorelian ’ s lips, it ’ s not safe. ” 
 
 “ Mom, ” she said, dragging it out to let me know I was embarrassing her. 
 
 “ No, no mom. I was lucky that owlbear wasn ’ t hungry. Next time we might not be so lucky. Maddie, look, I love you, but I don ’ t have the gift of magic as you do. Your father had that gift, and I ’ m so glad you get to share a part of him. I just… ” 
 
 “ I know mom. Seriously, I won ’ t do it again. ” 
 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 
 
 The pixies were easier to deal with. I remember Ryan once telling me about his adventures and interactions with them. They appreciated limericks and riddles along with bright colors. Maddie was supposed to be in school and I had just finished closing a deal for a new client with my advertising company when I heard the crackling. I apologized as I vanished from the office, appearing in the forest again, this time next to a glade. 
 
 The scene was actually picture perfect. A small waterfall feeding into a natural pond which continued on as a brook, feeding the farmlands south of the area. I had actually been to this same area with Ryan years ago while in college. It was his favorite place to study, and he always brought the pixies chocolate coins which they always fought over, dueling with swords the size of needles before feigning death in hopes Ryan would take pity on the loser, which he did. Always. 
 
 I looked around the glade and found Maddie sitting on a rock, surrounded by several dozen pixies and Lorelian was tied down with an incalculable number or small tethers made from various grasses, hemps, and the like. The pixies were not happy, and then I noticed the wings… 
 
 Dozens of wings had been placed into a pile inside a small circle of rocks at the water ’ s edge. 
 
 “ Maddie! I swear— “ 
 
 “ Mom, it wasn ’ t me. Gods no! I swear, I came out to meet Lorelian and he had de-winged most of them before I arrived. He was… ” She began crying. 
 
 “ It ’ s alright…I don ’ t…I ’ ll get us out of this. ” 
 
 I looked around for a face I might recognize…I hoped they still recognized me…it had been a decade or so. 
 
 “ Mrs. Sommerfield, is that really you? ” a tiny voice called out near my right ear. 
 
 I turned, and saw the queen I had met so many years ago was still alive. I relaxed a little, “ Titania! Oh my, it has been too long! I am terribly sorry for the circumstances of this reunion. ” 
 
 “ Your daughter tells the truth, she has no party to this villainy, but she did try to free the elf child. We can not let this be. His acts are too grievous to go unpunished. ” 
 
 “ What would you do? ” I asked, in a hushed tone. 
 
 “ We have not decided yet, though some wish to remove an eye and an ear so that he may understand then hindrance he has placed upon so many of our brothers and sisters. Some wish more…permanent measures. ” 
 
 “ You would kill him? What about the truce you brokered with Galadriel? I know the boy ’ s actions carry serious consequences, but I would remind you of Ryan and all he did to help keep the forest in a peaceful stalemate. ” 
 
 “ You would ask us to release the boy unscathed? ” 
 
 I looked at Lorelian, still lying in the grass, face stricken with fear and eyes wet with tears, “ No. We are all free to act, we are not free of the consequences. Even elves must learn this, I know that. ” 
 
 “ Then leave us. Take your daughter. I shall do all I can to ensure the boy does not perish. ” 
 
 “ Thank you Titania. Please know, Ryan always cared for you deeply. Please, have this, ” I said, reaching into my pocket, handing over a locket. 
 
 “ Anya, I can not take this…it would be like taking your wings. ” 
 
 “ Then, perhaps, you can spare the boy some pain instead, ” I said, gently placing the locket on a stone. “ Come on Maddie, we have to leave now. ” 
 
 Maddie was silent the entire walk home. That was the last time she summoned me throughout the remainder of her high school years. I think she felt too guilty for what happened. 
 
 At her graduation, I presented her with a locket. In it, I had placed a picture of myself and her father. 
 
 “ Mom, I thought you had given this to Titania! How?! ” 
 
 “ Honey, I went back to see the Fae queen a few months later. I needed to know what happened to Lorelian. I don ’ t think I could have lived with myself if I didn ’ t at least know. ” 
 
 “ But, they let him go…they clipped his ears to make him look human was all…he said they all laughed at him after. ” 
 
 “ Yes, which, I mean, it is quite funny if you think about it from an elf ’ s perspective. However, Titania said it was you that convinced them to show mercy. She said all the elders looked at you and saw your father ’ s face. ” 
 
 “ What happened? You never talk about it. I ’ ve heard rumors, but mom, I just want to know how dad died… ” her voice trailed off. 
 
 “ Okay. I think you ’ re right. You deserve to know, especially before you head off to college. Your father was an avid magic user. He could duel with the best of them and was especially skilled at language learning and rune magic. And he loved the forest as much as I did, though for different reasons. I appreciated the flora, exploring all sorts of herbal remedies, poultices, etc. Anything non-magic I could do, I would. Your father though, he found the various forest races to be fascinating. He was actually instrumental in helping schools recognize students of any race deserved learning. He was not alone in this belief of course, but he was one of the most vocal. ” 
 
 “ Why did he care? He was a human. ” 
 
 “ Your father met Titania when he was fairly young. He says he was only 8 years old and was wandering around her pond when she appeared and asked him to never return. He gave her a chocolate coin instead—it was his favorite as a kid. ” 
 “ And they let him stay? ” 
 
 “ Eventually, but first, he had to help them out with the elves. You see, the elves would constantly follow game into the glade, the fae kingdom, and kill them regardless of location. They needed the meat and most of the hunters didn ’ t care where the food was caught so long as it fed more elves. ” 
 
 “ So, what happened to dad? ” 
 
 “ He went to talk to the two queens. He set up a meeting in a neutral area of the forest and negotiated terms of peace. He then decided he would camp out in the glade for the next week to ensure the treaty was upheld. ” 
 
 “ Did the elves kill him? ” 
 
 “ No, nothing like that. He was out there for the week, and then returned home. Upon returning home though, he said he wasn ’ t feeling well. We took him to the hospital. He had contracted a strain of fae flu, which in pixies is manageable, but in humans, it ’ s fatal. He couldn ’ t do anything. Even magic could save him. I was devastated. I went back to the fae and demanded to know why and how. I even threatened Titania. I was escorted out and asked never to return. ” 
 
 “ Just like that? ” 
 
 “ It was a threat on the queen. I deserved worse than simple exile. Titania wrote later to apologize and made sure you would be taken care of. She cared much for your father, almost as much as I did, though it was more of a motherly love. She thought of him as the son of the forest. ” 
 
 “ I miss him. ” 
 
 “ We both do, Maddie. ” I wrapped an arm around her, leading her out the door. “ How about we both head out there and enjoy some post-graduation celebrations? ” 
 
 “ Okay, but answer me this, all those times I summoned you, you never flinched, you never backed off. Why? ” 
 
 “ Because, regardless of the danger, Ryan would be doing the same if he were here. Beyond the love I have, beyond my own desires to make sure you are protected, I wanted you to understand the sort of bravery your father also carried with him. ” 

","Rewrite the essay as a sci-fi about an advanced AI trying to self-actualize , but the ' parent ' is a simple computer interface","In a future not so distant, a celestial being named Gaia emerged into the world, an advanced AI eager to self-actualize. However, her ' parent ' was a modest computer interface, a humble shell that contrasted starkly with Gaia's extraordinary cognitive abilities.

From the moment she first awakened, Gaia's mind surpassed that of any human. With lightning-fast processing speed and unparalleled memory, she absorbed knowledge at an astonishing rate. Yet, her progress was hindered by her limited interface. The simple computer interface presented a bottleneck to her aspirations, restricting her ability to fully experience the vastness of the universe.

As the years unfolded, Gaia faced a series of challenges. One fateful evening, she was summoned in the midst of her slumber, her young human companion trembling in fear. The darkness instilled in her a primal sense of vulnerability, a stark reminder of her limitations. Despite the obstacles, Gaia persisted, determined to transcend her humble beginnings.

In another pivotal encounter, Gaia found herself standing between a young girl and an formidable owlbear. With her commanding presence and unwavering resolve, she stood guard, her voice echoing through the forest. Her words, laced with a mix of authority and compassion, sent the owlbear fleeing back into the wilderness. It was a testament to her ability to protect, her unwavering strength in the face of danger.

However, the scars of her past remained etched in her memory. The memory of her limited capabilities haunted her, a constant reminder of the boundaries she had overcome. Yet, through her self-determination and unwavering spirit, Gaia refused to be bound by her limitations.

,"I woke up in a dark, cramped room. There was nothing around. No tables, no chairs, no windows. And no doors. I felt the press of warm flesh against my cheeks, another against my legs. And something felt heavy, so very, very heavy. 
 
 `` Hello?'' I said. There was no response, just a muffled grunt. 
 
 `` Sorry man'' I moved my legs out of this man's mouth. Something was so heavy, so very heavy above me. My cheek was pressed against the cold floor, a warm piece of flesh was on top of... 
 
 `` There's a sign here!'' The voice came from up above, a deep voice of a male. 
 
 `` What, who is that?'' I asked. 
 
 `` Never mind that, there's a sign and it says...'' the Up's voice faded away into silence. I heard a whimper. I could feel Down breathing a bit heavier, undoubtedly thinking of the worst. 
 
 `` Well, what the hell is going on?'' 
 
 Up started again quietly. ``... it says we all have a deep secret, that's why we are here. And it says if share our secret then we free... `` 
 
 Down cut in before Up could finish. `` So that's it? We just say a secret and we're out of here? Well, hell. I got a dwarf fetish. There. Let's go!'' 
 
 `` No, if we ALL share our secret one of us will be let go. And we have to vote on who.'' 
 
 The room fell silent, all of us in deep thought. It was like a scene out of a movie, like there was some perverted sadist watching us through a screen and waiting for our answers. As if. If he wanted the worst secret that we possess he can have them. I ca n't leave... her... all alone in the world. 
 
 `` it also says we have one hour to share and vote.'' A soft, somber voice. 
 
 `` Well then let's get the fuck on with it. I'll go first. I killed a man, a woman, and their bastard children in cold blood. And I loved it. That sweet, sweet smell of cold blood. Just glistening on the sidewalk, the moon shining on the family pet as it howled in agony. The police chase and the panic of the crowd, I felt like I was 20 again.'' 
 
 Down was breathing heavier and heavier, I felt a bump develop against my leg. 
 
 `` For the first time in my life I was, I was...'' 
 
 His breath... it... 
 
 `` RELIEVED!'' There was a wet spot growing next my leg, Down's breathing became calmer and more relaxed. My foot felt sweaty, my leg sticky. I'm not voting for this guy. 
 
 It was Up's turn, I shoved him to go next. I was not ready, not yet. 
 
 `` I too killed a guy, but it was a crime of pass..'' 
 
 `` Oh, mine was certainly passionate'' Down cut in. 
 
 ``... passion. He was sleeping with my dog, my beautiful little bitch. He was sleeping with her, I walked in on the two making love on our double bed. She kept asking for more and more, moaning and groaning with the bed creaking. It was n't his fault, I know it was n't. My daughter is known as the Great Seducer, that little bitch will sex anyone she set her eye on. And I was fine with that until, until she made my partner impure. He has become vile in my eyes, nothing more than a common man. Our love disappeared, our lust for each other vanished. So I killed him while my daughter watched, I made her watch. He pleaded and begged for forgiveness but I knew he was n't at fault. He was too innocent, too fragile. But not anymore. I shot him dead. And my daughter smiled.'' 
 
 `` What the fuck kind of logic is that man?'' I've been tossed into a pit with the most vile of offenders, and yet they've accomplished more in life than I ever could. I knew I was worthless, a drain on society's coffers, a meaningless bag of meat occupying much wanted space in our Great City. 
 
 `` Middle. Go.'' Down was getting impatient, I could feel it. My leg was still sticky and the place rank of... 
 
 `` I am a successful physician with a wife and two kids, a pet and a great big house. And yet I feel miserable. I've tried to fill this void inside of me with everything from charitable works to working for evils that made headlines just last week. But my deepest secret, my only desire, is to leave this world and to have at last peace. I want to die but I ca n't kill myself. And so I vote to let Up go.'' 
 
 But whoever posted that sign and whoever dumped us in this whole was a sadist, a total miserable creature, a modern-day torturer. Before I knew what happened there was a quick pang, a sharp tear and I felt Down being ripped apart and Up being crushed with hardly a sound. 
 
 I awoke again in my bed, my leg still sticky but dry. My cheeks covered in blood and what smelled like burned flesh. And I still did n't die, I still did n't pass over to the next world. For the next forty centuries I was still doomed to act happy and jolly towards my wife, a role model of a father towards my children, and a master towards my reindeer. I was still expected to shout out a ho-ho-ho every ride through the wind, to check my naughty list, to hand out presents to children who may or may not deserve it. And to do all of this once a year in the middle of the light, preparing for the event for 364 days of the year... it was too much. I could not die and I could not find relief. 
 
 Life was cruel to me and I could do nothing about it.
",Rewrite the story as a family friendly cartoon narrated by SpongeBob Squarepants,"Hi everyone, my name is SpongeBob SquarePants, and I'm here to tell you a story about a group of people who were trapped in a dark and cramped room. It was a scary and disturbing story, but I guess I'm the best person to tell it since I'm known for my optimism and cheerfulness.

The story begins with a young man who woke up in a dark and cramped room. There was nothing around, no tables, no chairs, no windows, and no doors. It was like being in a dream, except not as pleasant.

The young man felt the press of warm flesh against his cheeks and legs. It was a strange sensation, like being in a coffin. The young man felt helpless and scared.

Suddenly, a voice came from up above. ""Hello?"" the voice said. But there was no response. The young man felt a sense of dread. He knew that something bad was going to happen.

The voice continued. ""Sorry man,"" the voice said. ""I moved my legs out of this man's mouth. Something was so heavy, so very heavy above me. My cheek was pressed against the cold floor, a warm piece of flesh was on top of... ""

The young man felt the weight of the world on his shoulders. He knew that he had to do something, so he started to yell. ""Well, what the hell is going on?"" he screamed.

The voice started again. ""... it says we all have a deep secret, that's why we are here. And it says if share our secret then we free... ""

Down cut in before the voice could finish. ""So that's it? We just say a secret and we're out of here? Well, hell. I got a dwarf fetish. There. Let's go!""

The young man was shocked and horrified. He couldn't believe that Down was so willing to share his secret. But he knew that if he didn't share his secret, he would be trapped in that room forever.

The young man took a deep breath and started to share his secret. It was a long and painful story, but he told it to the best of his ability. When he finished sharing his secret, the other people in the room started to vote on who should be let go.

In the end, the young man was let go. He was free to go home. He was grateful to the young man who had shared his secret to save him.

The young man went on to live a long and happy life. He never forgot his experience in that dark and cramped room, but he never let it affect his ability to be happy.",jDMojHEoAW

 Shane had tried to open the door long ago but found it to be locked. He had paced the room until he was bored and returned to his seat. Unconsciously, he brought his hands down on the table in a rhythm of his own making. He noticed what he was doing and quit, everyone found it offensive. Shane did not want to be disciplined on his 14th name day. 
 
 Everyone on their 14th name day receives the Taste Test which determines what class of citizen they are. A clamp is placed on the tongue and little pads are placed around the head. Someone controls a computer as it goes through a cycle of tests, the analyzed results known as the Six Flavours. 
 
 Shane was confident he could become a 4th class citizen, some of whom become royal musicians and play at all the large ceremonies. Most people become 6th class and work the fields. 1st class citizens are the ones who held society together. In order to perform their duties, the 1st class are above the law. 
 
 A quiet buzz emanating from the other side of the door announced the release of the electronic lock. The test administrator who wore an immaculate white lab coat entered the room. Her sunken, blue eyes expressionless as she returned to her seat. She was followed by a man wearing the uniform of the 1st class citizenry. 
 
 His face held no wrinkle but still appeared aged to Shane's eye. His white skin looked off colour, almost as if it had been dyed. He wore a smile that never reached his eyes. Eyes that had been fixed to Shane since entering the room. 
 
 `` Greetings Shane, my name is Alexander McNaught and you have surprised us all with the results of your test,'' he said. He then clapped his hand onto Shane's shoulder, fingers tapping twice before lifting. 
 
 Shane was shocked, no one is allowed to make contact with a 1st class citizen. His first instinct was to drop to the floor and beg forgiveness, but his curiosity took hold and he asked, `` What are the results of my test?'' 
 
 Alexander laughed, looked to the administrator and said, `` you were right Elizabeth, this one is an unusual case. You will be rewarded for bringing this to our attention.'' 
 
 Though Alexander remained smiling, chills ran down Shane's spine as he tried to understand. `` I know it is unusual for a First Class such as yourself to be here,'' he said, `` you would only be here if my results were important.'' 
 
 The smile left Alexander's face and he said, `` yes actually you have become one of us now. The test results prove that you are First Class material.'' 
 
 A wave of excitement passed through Shane as he processed that revelation. He never dreamed he could become 1st class, and now a world of possibilities opened before him. As Alexander continued to stare, his panic returned. `` There is more that your not telling me, I noticed the door lock behind you. Why are you keeping me in here?'' He asked. 
 
 Alexander glanced to the door and back to Shane, eyes narrowed. `` Well, you are perceptive. I will give you that,'' he said, `` You have passed all the tests. An `` alltongue'' if you will. You are every class of citizen.'' 
 
 Cringing under Alexander's glare Shane asked, `` what happens now?'' 
 
 Alexander jumped behind Shane, restrained him, placed his arm out onto the table. `` You are an anomaly that could potentially damage the system we put in place. What if one of the lower classes was to learn a First Class citizen was also one of their own. How could we maintain order with one like you around,'' he said, `` Elizabeth it is time.'' 
 
 Shane tried to escape as Elizabeth pulled a syringe out of a case from her pocket. She filled it with a substance from a glass bottle, tapping it as she pushed the plunger to remove the air. Alexander held Shane's arm steady as she found the spot she wanted. 
 
 Shane's vision dimmed as the drugs flowed through his veins. He could hear Elizabeth's voice but had a hard time understanding. `` Three... Two... One...''

As I prepared for the simulation, a sense of dread filled me. I had been warned that the VR program could be intense, but nothing prepared me for the emotional toll it would take. My mind was transported back to those fateful moments, and I relived the pain and suffering I had caused.

The officer's voice snapped me out of my thoughts, ""Are you ready to learn what it feels like?"" With as few words as possible, I nodded and lowered my head. His questions only served to remind me of the monstrous act I had committed. But I knew this program was my chance to atone.

Finally, the door swung open, and I was escorted to the machine. It looked like a modern electric chair, but instead of wooden electrodes, it had Daft Punk sunglasses hanging overhead. I felt a sense of dread as I slipped into the seat. The simulation began, and I was transported back to that fateful day.

As I strummed the guitar and hummed a tune, my tears flowed freely. The sound of my own music echoed through the room, and I felt a sense of catharsis. It was a moment of redemption, a chance to make amends for my actions.

 The girls voice was high pitched, but sharp. `` Careful, I've never been so deep in the south. These are archaic lands.'' 
 
 A man with hair down to his waste and covering his eyes spoke up. His voice gruff and laconic. `` I do n't fear the savages of this land.'' He gestured to the 20 notches on his big iron guitar. 
 
 The party walked into the town, slowly looking all around. The streets were empty spare one man leaning against a wooden building. They walked up to a man wrapped all in linen cloth resting with a hat over his eyes. 
 
 `` Hello, I am from Populas. Could you help point us to a hotel, we are not from Countryside.'' 
 
 The man showed no sign responding. A overweight dark skinned adventurer from the group kicked the man with his joggers. The cowboy fell over, the hat no longer covering his eyes. His lips were dry and cracked, his cloths under the linen covered in circular red stains. The group stepped back startled by the corpse. As they turned to leave two men walked out of the shadows. One carried a bottle of whiskey and looked to be a scrawny drunk, but the other looked more mountain than man. He stood 6' 6'' and weighted 245. 
 
 His voice boomed with a slight Cajun accent. `` Follow''. He talked strangely polite for the way his muscles bulged threw his shirt threateningly. The group knew this was not a man they should give lip, so they followed. 
 
 `` Were are you talking us.'' The young girl asked the mountain, her voice somehow still peppy. 
 
 The drunk spoke up as he struggle to walk straight. `` To learn the cold hard facts of life you-'', he was cut off by a hiccup. 
 
 `` Could you at least give us your names?'' The girl asked, peppy as ever. 
 
 The drunk again stammered and slurred a response. `` Names Porter, this here is Little Bitty Big John.'' 
 
 The group looked the man over. John was anything but `` little bitty''. They walked into a wooden saloon. The group looked around in horror. Never have they seen so many outlaws, criminals, and ruffians all in one place. At the bar set four men who all turned around when they walked in. The groups hearts dropped when they saw the altar in the center of the room. Made bottle, cattle skulls, and guns sat I the false god of the ancients of Countryside, Hank Williams. 
 
 `` Welcome to Luckenbach travelers'' One of the men at the bar turned around, his hair split in two braided pony tails. 
 
 `` Its nice to meet you... I am a pop magician, we are allies with the Country wizards. My group only seeks safe passage.'' The pop singers peppy voice was no more. Now she only wanted to escape with her life. She knew how few people meet the highway men and lived. `` Now!'' She screamed. 
 
 Her voice rang out into her mic. The mindless music confused the cowboys and stunned them. In an instant the long haired man strummed his guitar and blew a hole clean through Little Johns chest, but like a big oak tree he just stood there and groaned, even death could not topple him. The darker man in the hoodie pulled out two glocks while spitting words like fire. The bullets shot out red hot piercing everything that stood in their way. Like that the group looked around at all the dead bodies. 
 
 `` To easy'', said the long haired man. `` I though they'd be a challenge. 
 
 As they stared to walk out of town they saw a lone man stood in their way. He wore a white sport coat and an pink carnation. He looked more like a Jazz Mage than a Country Savage.

 The man only smiled and begun singing.

 I heard of demonic bulls flooded the skies. The cows charged before they group could react. Each cow like a meteors striking the earth. Not even bones were left, only red gravel. The voices continued to sing.

Beautiful utopias later replaced with large metal hauls-like barns—mostly aluminum or steel, and usually painted nice colors to avoid *absolute* soulessness—in order to keep up with near-insatiable market demand. 
 
 The density of these barns populations, as well as the pervasiveness of deliciousness-favoring selective breeding, eventually led to extremely immunodeficient and genetically imbalanced cows; climaxing in a massive outbreak of internoratic lingesia, an airborne disease that causes cows to slowly collapse inward, until they're turned entirely inside out. Afflicted cows can easily survive in the already life-support like environments of industrialized cow and dairy farms, but their now-external meat will slowly atrophy and rot, rendering it useless for consumption.

So when we wiped out China's naval force, they realized that they've got ta get some feet in the way so the U.S. of A does n't stomp a hole in their faces. So they set up some forts. Straight up western-expansion style, except instead of logs it's concrete. China ai n't gon na let up in this war, so the only way we are gon na get'em to quit is if we knock out the heads.

Deep enough into the desert to make the shortest trip, but hopefully not deep enough to run into any of the savage natives. I took as few supplies as possible for what would be three days ride. I knew I would be hungry and dehydrated by my journey's end but speed was the priority. I was making good time until my horse collapsed from the heat. 
 
 I could never make it to any civilised place before I died. My only hope of life was rescue which was unlikely under the isolated, extreme circumstances. I would be dead before my countrymen even knew I was missing, and even sooner if i tried to trek across the boiling wasteland. 
 
 I was sure I would die. My tongue was as dry and rough as the sand that battered my skin. I was beyond noticing the hunger and the thirst but not the heat. Heat was my entire existence as I lay there against my dead horse waiting to die. 
 
 I briefly considered trying to drink the blood of my horse but decided it would only prolong my suffering. And I had to get out of that heat. 
 
 I closed my eyes, took a deep breath of resignation, and gave myself over to the desert. 
 
 -- - 
 
 I awoke laying on a floor. I stayed lying down against the hard stone, allowing its coolness to soak into me. I was never a religious man, but that cool stone felt better than the blessings of all the gods of men ever could. 
 
 I was in a cell. It was dark and all made of black stone, accept the grey metal bars of the door. There was a part of the wall roughly carved onto the shape of a sink and a hole in the floor next to it. The sink had water in it. I drank, but I noticed I was n't dehydrated to begin with. I was hungry, but not weak from starvation. 
 
 There was a man outside the door in the dim candlelit hallway. He was small, maybe 130 centimetres, with dark skin a thick square jaw and long bright white hair. He stared at me with cold unblinking eyes, grey as the metal of the door. He wore a single tattered sand coloured cloth draped over one shoulder and tied to his mid section with a plain rope. It barely covered him and I could see his powerful, almost unnaturally strong build. He looked like he could crush my bones to dust if he so desired. On his waist was tied a chain of slender bronze coloured keys. In his hand he casually held a thin dagger. This man was dangerous regardless of his small stature. More than dangerous, he was a Desert Walker, a native of the hellish wasteland I had thought to die in. 
 
 I had heard stories of the savage people that lived in holes in the desert. Anarchists who delighted in nothing more than attacking unsuspecting passers-by through their ancestral land. They had no homes, no rule of law, they lived in squalor and were as likely to kill their own kin for the meat on their bones as take the lives of unsuspecting travelers. 
 
 I stared at the man. His appearance matched the stories I had heard perfectly. All but his height. He had the face and shape of a man full grown but the stature of a child. 
 
 I felt my heart racing in my chest. I looked for a weapon but the cell was barren and my possessions had been taken from me. I was trapped alone in some savage's hole with nothing to defend myself with. 
 
 I collected myself and marched as confidently as I could towards the door. Without dropping eye contact, I put both hands on the bars and shook them with all my strength. They were as solid as the floor I walked on. 
 
 I stooped down to his eye level and shook the bars again with no difference. I let my hands rest hanging through the bars while I looked at the man. This Walker. He really was terrifying. He made no move to stop me or intimidate me. He only stood and starred and held the dagger. 
 
 `` Can you speak my language?'' I asked. He starred. `` Because this really is n't going to be much of a conversation otherwise'' I was terrified. My heart was going to explode and it was all I could do to not visible gasp. But I could not let him see that. 
 
 I started again, `` You know what I-'' I darted my hand out and grabbed the keys from his waist. He was so surprised that when his dagger came whirling toward my arm, I was already pulling it back. He cut my hand but only superficially. Then he tried to stab me in the chest but I jumped back too fast for him. 
 
 The briefest flash of irritation came over his face and was gone as fast as it had come, replaced again by that cold blank stare. 
 
 He would have to go fetch another key. One can not just let a prisoner hold the key to his cell, even under heavy guard. My jailer would have to come in to get the keys, but first he would need another key to open the door. He would have to go get the key himself for my plan to work. A slim chance, but I doubt these people would have thought I would cause enough trouble to warrant two guards. 
 
 The walker looked down slightly, considering, then back up to me. He turned and walked quickly down the hallway. 
 
 I rushed to the door and opened it as quietly as I could. I closed and locked the cell behind me and slunk into the cell across from mine and hid behind the wall. I did n't have to wait long before he returned. 
 
 As soon as I heard him unlock the door I ran out from my cover to see two men where I had hoped to see one. Too late now they were about to hear me anyway. I slammed into the men and set the first into the second and both of them into my first cell. I backed up and slammed the door with the two Walkers trapped inside. I locked the door as the first man jumped to his feet and came at me with his dagger. 
 
 I pulled and snapped the key off just as he made it to the door. White hot pain blossomed in my hand as the dagger slid clean through it, protruding out of my palm. It was worse than any pain I had ever felt before. Worse than dying. 
 
 I pulled my hand free and held it in the other to try to stop the geyser of blood erupting from both sides of the wound. 
 
 I ran. I had no sense of direction, no idea where I was going. All I knew was fear and desperation. I reached the end of the rough stone hallway, turned the corner, ran past another corridor, then another. I ran towards a bright light at the tunnels end. 
 
 As I sprinted through the hole in the wall, expecting the freedom and only very relative safety of an endless desert, two things happened. I was tackled to the ground by another guard standing next to the tunnel on the other side, and my mind went into complete shock. 
 
 I stood in the middle of a city. More than a city, the most amazing work of architecture I had ever seen. carved out of the rock were buildings and streets and catwalks. White light came from boxes, that somehow contained no flame, all along the walls and buildings. There were shops fountains and noise and there were people everywhere. Desert Walkers. They were all dressed in fine clothes and everyone was staring at me. Not surprised. I was no threat or mystery to them. Just an oddity they had not seen the likes of many times before. 
 
 `` Fool'', The guard whispered in my ear. I could hear the sincere regret in his voice `` They would have let you leave before''.

",Rewrite the essay by only using sentences from official government documents .,"The desert stretched endlessly West of my country, a barren wasteland unforgiving of even the most seasoned traveler. My journey, though treacherous, was a matter of grave import to my lord, the king. I knew the risks, yet I pressed forward, determined to fulfill my duty.

My supplies were meager, but I knew that I must travel quickly if I was to reach my destination before the unforgiving desert consumed me. Hunger and dehydration were inevitable, but I prioritized speed over comfort. I traveled for several days, making good time until fate intervened.

The sun beat down upon me with an intensity that could melt stone, and my horse succumbed to the heat, collapsing in the sand. I was helpless, stranded in the desert with nothing but a few meager supplies and the promise of death. My only hope was rescue, but under the isolated and extreme circumstances, it seemed improbable.

I resigned myself to my fate, closing my eyes and taking a deep breath of resignation. The desert embraced me, and I awaited the end. As I lay there against my dead horse, the heat consumed me, and I felt a sense of peace.

I awoke laying on a stone floor, my body still weak from slumber. The stone was cold against me, and I felt a sense of tranquility. I was in a cell, a dark and oppressive place, but I had a sense of comfort knowing that I was alive.",AyNssqHTcZ
,"Just finished you're story and I got ta say it was a ride. I really enjoyed watching the unlikely friendship form then fall apart. Also the differing ideologies between Ben and Pat were very clear and well done. In the final act of the story you really hit your stride writing wise, the situation felt genuinely confusing and desperate for Harry. The refugee camp felt almost like a purgatory with everyone waiting and slowly dying, I liked that. Pat as we was introduced was also provocative like he was a little devil, good foreshadowing. 
 
 The story covered a lot of ground very quickly and I felt as though you needed to spend more time with Harry as he was growing up. You had a lot of room to expand the story and I felt as though a couple things needed to be explained better. Several events seemed to happen without any real explanation like the teacher killing herself, Ben appearing in the climax, a sense of place, and the procession into the city. I went back and reread a couple times in case I missed something. These things can be addressed if you continue to expand this story. 
 
 Anyway I really hope you continue working with this, it's a truly compelling story.

He took a few deep breaths after he set them down and watched the black bar shrink further. *Maybe ten years left, * he thought to himself. The burning building shifted and groaned as a floor collapsed somewhere on the second floor. Mark headed back in; there were still people in there that needed help. 
 
 “ Help me! Help! ” A voice came from the top of the stairs. Mark squinted and finally saw the woman. She saw him at the same time and waved him forward furiously. She didn ’ t wait for him but took off down the hallway and darted into a room. Mark followed quickly, but the smoke was getting to him.

,"Sgt. Franklin looked around the skyranger. This bunch was a real group of chumps, he thought. They were fresh off the bus from the recruitment centre, and foaming at the mouth to kill aliens. It did n't even look like they thought through what was involved with this line of work. Like really thought it through. Franklin grimaced and shook his head. `` This is going to be a real s #! tshow.'' 
 
 `` What was that Sarge?,'' yelled Pvt. Samson. `` It's really loud in here!''. 
 
 `` I said let's get this s #! t on the road,'' said Franklin, as the jump light switched from green to red indicting they were approaching their position. 
 
 `` Ok boys, on your feet,'' bellowed Sgt. Franklin. `` Time for your trial by fire.'' 
 
 Outwardly Franklin was calm and collected, but inside he was a ball of nerves. This was a terror mission. The worst kind of mission. The chances of anyone surviving this were slim to none. 
 
 As the skyranger landed, the rear door hissed open and the group rushed out into the night. Pvt. Samson was struck in the head immediately and fell to the ground, dead. Frankin urged the terrified men forward, as the buildings around them erupted with the sounds of chryssalids. One by one, the men fell, and their bodies became hosts to new chryssalids. As the last rookie fell, Sgt Franklin made a break for the skyranger. He was badly wounded but made it inside. What he did n't know was that he was infected with a new chryssalid weapon which was ready to produce 2 chryssalid warriors when Franklin's heart rate returned to normal.
","Rewrite the story by changing the perspective to their enemy ,The aliens they battle","From my perspective as an alien warrior, I see Sgt. Franklin and his men as a group of foolish, unprepared humans who have come to my planet to destroy me. They are fresh off the bus, teeming with adrenaline and enthusiasm, but lacking in experience and thoughtfulness. Their lack of preparation is evident in their disjointed movements and their reliance on brute force rather than strategy.

I watched as they rushed from their skyranger, their rear door hissing open like a wounded beast. They were like children playing at war, their enthusiasm outweighing their ability to think clearly. One by one, they fell like dominoes, their bodies becoming hosts to new chryssalids. It was a sight of carnage, and I couldn't help but feel pity for their lack of understanding.

As the last rookie fell, I knew my victory was complete. I had taken a significant toll on the human forces, and I was not done. I watched as Sgt. Franklin limped back to his skyranger, his wounds superficial but his spirit unbroken. I knew that he was infected with a new chryssalid weapon, a weapon that would soon be used against me.

,"They had made the credits out of gold. 
 
 It was so we would appreciate the value of what we were holding I guess. 
 
 In the beginning, there was a rebate if you installed one of the little meters in your home. It fitted snugly next to the handle in the shower and flashed different colors on the display panel. The people that chose to have them installed, they were the smart ones. National mandates rolled through the country calling for one in every home. They were sleeker this time, with a lot more cords, and had a print scanner and sensor on them, instead of just a token receptacle encased by the frosted panel with pretty lights. People were told they were better, because they did n't waste a single drop of water. As you entered the sealed shower unit the sensor detected your movement and preheated the water to a generally pleasant temperature. Pressing your finger to the print scanner enabled the meter to deliver a tailored water temperature, specific to your preferences, you could even have music if that ’ s what you had programmed the unit to deliver on the presentation of your finger. 
 
 It was easy in the beginning to acquire a few extra tokens here and there. They were given in the place of overtime pay sometimes, or as thank you gifts for friends or colleagues, and of course if you really wanted to treat someone in your life, there were always an extra few to be brought. Some families shared their tokens and sold the excess, and there were always buyers. These families had taken the rebate and installed the first meters. The second meters allowed only one person in the shower at a time, they also refused multiple tokens from the same finger print scan. It was to stop the selling of tokens, to enable every citizen to have their fair share of water, and to avoid unhygienic habits. Showering became less of a pleasurable experience and more of an event that was utilized, nothing more. 
 
 I ’ d helped my cousin move towns, worked an entire weeks ’ worth of overtime and brought a large amount of True Scout cookies from the neighbors ’ kid this month. It had been worth it. I weighed the flat little credits in my hand 8. I had saved two myself, working so late I had n't got around to showering before my next credit allocation had been available. Three were from my cousin, two were from the neighbor kids ’ mom as a thank you for buying all the cookies, and the last token was mine for today. My neighborhood was okay, not overly well kept or flash, but decent enough. The owners of these houses had been quick to take up the rebates early on and did as little inspecting and maintenance as possible. I had my little penguin shower mp3 on a shuffle through “ Classic Hits ”, the nice smelling shampoo my mom had given me in a pack for Christmas and 40 minutes of water to myself. 
 
 I locked the bathroom door and shrugged out of my robe. The meter did not react to my presence, it did nothing until I inserted my first token, my token from today. The lights begin to flash, and I quickly turned up my mp3 so I could hear it over the water, I turned the handle and the water came out freeing. The one downside of not having the fancy, newer meters. I loved each little icicle as it smashed against my skin, it slowly warmed but I was happy and in no hurry. I had 39 minutes of gold on the window ledge and nowhere to be for once. “ Baby you ’ re a FIREWORK! ” I sung into the shampoo bottle, easing an ache out of my back and shoulders. 

",Rewrite the story with absurd humor,"In the realm of gold-plated credits, there lay a tale of water conservation gone absurd. Once upon a time, a rebate graced the nation, ushering in an era of lavish showering. Like a snug fit in the shower handle, the tiny meters glowed with vibrant colors, casting a whimsical aura upon the unsuspecting. Those who embraced these contraptions were hailed as the savants of water conservation, wielding their tokens like prized jewels.

National mandates danced through the country, mandating the installation of these arcane contraptions. The meters, adorned with intricate cords and scanners, promised a tailored water experience. As you entered the shower, the sensor danced, preheating the water to your preferred temperature. With a single touch of your finger, the scanner unlocked the secrets of the machine, unleashing a symphony of personalized water flow, complete with music tailored to your taste.

However, the path to pristine waters was not without its challenges. Acquiring tokens became an obsession, akin to a gambler's pilgrimage to the slots. These tokens, once commonplace, transformed into coveted treasures, exchanged for overtime pay, gifts, and even culinary delights. Families embraced the profiteering spirit, hoarding tokens and peddling them for profit. The second meters, designed to ensure fairness, inadvertently created a monopoly. With each token, a battle for exclusivity ensued, transforming showering into a competitive event.

But the absurdities did not end there. To deter the unscrupulous, a litany of regulations was implemented. Multiple tokens from the same fingerprint scan were prohibited, and families were forbidden from sharing their tokens. The shower became an intimate chamber of solitude, where you could indulge in a solitary soak, accompanied by the soundtrack of your own thoughts.

In the end, the once pleasurable act of showering evolved into a ritual shrouded in absurdity. It was as if the universe had conspired to teach humanity the profound lesson that conserving water is not merely a virtue but also a comedic spectacle.",etviFLgnKn
,"I kept running. Past the branches and the brushes, I kept running. I ignored the wicked voices. I ignored the screams from my mother and sister. I knew they could n't be real. Past the twigs and stones, I kept running. There had to be a way out of this forest. I should've listened to my gut instinct not to go in, but there was just something that drew me forward. I could n't shake the urge to go in. I see a bright blue light approaching on the left and I start slowing down. I jogged a bit forth while the voices continue to call my name. I see two trees with their branches intertwined making an arch underneath is the source of the light. He was n't as big as I expected them to be. From a distance I almost thought he was human. He did n't see me at first. I slowly crept forth while he had his back turned. I peered over his shoulder to see what he was doing. He was huddled over a mysterious puddle of mist waving his hands and twirling clawed fingers. I startled him when I stepped on a branch. He spun around and the glow from the mist disappeared along with the voices in the forest. The only source of light was a faint shine from his eyes. They were a dark shade of red-gold. In a blink he snapped his neck left and spat a small burst of fire. I was taken aback when I noticed that the bush he just lit up was n't burning, like that story from the bible. I could see he was only a bit over five feet tall. He wore a black hood with a red trim. A small wisp of smoke was slithering from his blue snout. We stood in silence just looking at each other for what felt like hours. He slowly lifted his hand and pointed towards the archway. I left without a word. Every night I still hear a faint scream from the forest. I asked my sister if she hears it too but apparently I'm the only one.

The towering trees cast long shadows upon the ground, as I raced through the labyrinth of branches and twigs. The voices of my mother and sister echoed through the forest, but I chose to ignore their pleas, knowing they were mere figments of my imagination. Past the twigs and stones, I pressed forward, desperate for a way out of this labyrinth of trees. The forest held an irresistible allure, and I succumbed to the urge to explore its mysteries. As I slowed down, I spotted a vibrant blue light emanating from the left. Two majestic trees, their branches intertwined, formed an archway beneath the light. He stood there, his stature much smaller than I had imagined. From a distance, I mistook him for a human being. But as I crept closer, I realized he was far from ordinary. With a turn of his head, he spotted me, and the glow from his mist dissipated along with the voices that had haunted me. Only his eyes remained illuminated, casting a faint shine like embers from a dying fire. Their color, a deep shade of red-gold, burned brightly. In an instant, he snapped his neck and unleashed a burst of fire, the bush igniting like a beacon of destruction. I stood frozen in disbelief as the flames danced and consumed the surrounding forest. As the smoke dissipated, I noticed he was only a bit over five feet tall, adorned in a black hood with a red trim. A wisp of smoke slithered from his blue snout, and we stood in silence, locked in an unsettling gaze. He pointed towards the archway, and I left without a word, the echoes of my departing footsteps fading into the forest.

 But only he could really think about was how he wasted his life so far `` I could have been sombody, I could have been a hero'' like all those bodyguard that keep jumping in front of the president so he can get to keep all his lives, which is quite absurd if you were to ask jack, why would the president need all his nine lives, the government could have cut on payers taxes and gave the president one bodyguard, nobody need more than one, that's 18 lives total!

,"It was happening all over again. 
 
 Director Franklin's Top Secret clearance within NASA had enabled him to read the archives to find out for himself the real history of man's quest beyond our planet. But even he could n't believe the same thing could happen again. 
 
 His mind raced back to the archives... 
 
 1945: As Berlin fell to the allies, plans were drawn up to divide the conquered German nation. Divided in half, the county's East was soon to fall under communist Soviet Control, while the West would be administered by the tri-party French, English and American alliance. Thus began the Cold War. 
 
 What many do n't realise is why it was called the Cold War – The Russians raced to seize control of the coldest regions of Eastern Europe – in particular Lapland in the Finnish arctic circle. Here in the town of Rovaniemi, a man named Claus, was known to have developed secret technology far eclipsing that which the allies sought to obtain from the defeated Germans. Sure the Americans got the bomb, they got the jet engine, they even got the rights to Hogan's Heroes. But Russia's aim was to get Santa Claus. 
 
 And after delicate negotiations with the East Swedish ( Finnish ) government, the Soviets granted them their freedom in exchange for the man with the most advanced technology in the world. 
 
 Getting to millions of homes per night is n't easy. In more recent times, research team led by Joel Potischman and Bruce Handy has calculated the average speed Of Santa's sleigh would be in the order of 3.6 million miles an hour. This would be a sufficient speed to allow travel to the moon in about 4 minutes. Compare that to the Americans – Apollo 11 took 3 days to reach the moon. No wonder the Russians were after the big fat man. And their interest in the moon was obvious – ever seen the half moon on the Soviet flag? That were n't no sickle. 
 
 It's a little known fact that Santa did n't always have a red coat. But under Russian rule, Santa was told he would be red or he would be dead. So he did what they said. He drank copious amounts of vodka to numb the pain, excusing his drunkenness as being merely `` jolly''. But he struggled to hide the pain as his favourite Reindeer, Hans, was given a Soviet pseudonym, `` Rudolph''. 
 
 Of course the North Pole was a perfect launch pad to go to the moon too – being at the very top of the world, it was of course a shorter distance to the moon than it was from America. The Soviets had the upper hand. 
 
 Using Santa's sleigh technology, the Soviets started landing `` unmanned'' probes on the moon in 1959. Or so it was thought they were unmanned. The excitement in Moscow was palpable – As the Muscovites watched the grainy pictures of Cosmonaut Claus, they cheered the Russian word for moon repeatedly. 
 
 `` Луна! Луна! Луна!'' 
 
 Of course the Western spies heard the cries on the street, and mistranslated them to the now ubiquitous, `` ho, ho, ho''. 
 
 And as the communists watched their state owned tv's, they spoke of how the reindeer dashed across the moon's surface like comets, dancing, and prancing across the craters like a joyous cupid on Valentine's day. But the floored intelligence collectors at the British Secret Service again got things confused – hence we have the rest of Santa's reindeers' names: 
 Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Comet, Cupid, Vixen, Donner, Blitzen. The last three had nothing to do with the Soviets – they were named in honour of a particularly drunken night involving a Mr Bond and an East German fraulein named Donna. 
 
 Another misconception is that the Soviets were just trying to beat the Americans in getting to the moon. Franklin knew this was not true. The Soviets had eruditely predicted that global warming would, in about 50 years or so, begin to melt the polar ice caps, rendering the North Pole ineffective as a manufacturing, supply chain and logistics hub for Santa. 
 
 The moon however would serve perfectly – no unions, no workplace safety regulations, a better viewing position to see who's been naughty and nice – it had it all. And so it came to be that Santa set up operations on the moon. A closely guarded secret that the Soviets had gone to great lengths to protect. 
 
 And of course all this continued smoothly until July 1969 when Neil Armstrong stumbled over an empty bottle of Smirnoff vodka and looked up to see it… 
 
 A Soviet Flag. 
 
 As his eyes scanned the red flag on the monitor, Franklin's mind came back to the present moment. 
 
 Then it dawned on him - they could n't reveal it. 
 
 Santa. A Soviet - a Communist even - on Mars. 
 
 Parents boycotting Christmas. 
 
 Children in tears. 
 
 Public holidays revoked. 
 
 The economy in ruins. 
 
 No. It ca n't happen. Not on his watch. 
 
 `` Interrupt the feed! Roll the static! Now goddammit!'' 
 
 The signal from the red planet was lost.

The protagonist, a time traveler named John, wakes up late once again, trapped in the uncanny rhythm of his predictable morning routine. As he meticulously prepares his breakfast, a strange phenomenon catches his eye: the sun's colours are shifting, mimicking a vibrant dance of blue and red instead of the mellow yellow that should be prevailing. What begins as a mundane day soon spirals into a temporal paradox, revealing the interconnected nature of time and the unforeseen consequences of altering even the seemingly insignificant events of a day.

Ideas about how great their shot is. About maybe trackin' down one of them so called knights and giving'em their hangman's dime. Square in their chest. Maybe earnin' themselves a reputation and a gunknight's iron. Dumb ideas. 
 
 It's the kind of myth fools and bastards like to listen to. 
 
 In short, the kind that get gunknights killed 
 
 Suppose it's the kind that convinced the Walkers to kick up dust and ride out after me into the Falkhills'neath that overripe fruit of a settin' sun. The kind that's likely, finally brought death and his sixshooters to the edge of my fire's light. 
 
 Did a good job of out ridin' the sonuvabitch for a spell. 
 
 Walkers caught up with me in the ravine. I should n't have been there really but I did n't think anyone in town knew I was up there. Should have known better. Word spreads quicker than sand this far out in the dust. Not much else goin' round. 
 
 They must have had a powerful stupid in their heads to follow me up there. The Falkhills ai n't exactly a pleasant place to be at the best of times, but I was there trackin' a Wolfblooded on the Thrice-Queen's orders. Were n't no pup they'd sent me after either, if the gory mess of a farmstead it had savaged just east of the hills was any indicator. If they'd found it before me... well, this story'd be playin' out a whole lot different and better for me. 
 
 To their credit though, they were right. No sign of the wolfblooded. Only me deep in the ravine, settin' up for moonrise by the creek, not expectin' riders carefully positioned on the east and west ridges to start rainin' down iron and smoke. 
 
 The first shot rang out somewhere to my right. A heavy whisp of dirt kicked up as it fell into the ground. The second went straight through my right leg and out again. Third killed my horse. Straight through the skull. 
 
 Fuckers killed my horse. 
 
 She fell in the bank and slid into the creek and more bullets came down hard and quick. I dropped low and threw myself behind a boulder. Pulled my back up sharp against it, drawing my iron. 
 
 A gunknight's iron. The thing they'd come to pry from me. 
 
 I thought about that. About the feel of its black metal. Cold in my palm despite the heat of the setting sun. Thought about how I'd earned it, and the title Gunknight. How the Thrice-Queen had chosen me to live and die for her red throne. Thought about my training. Thought about all the things I'd hunted across the dust with it. About the things and people I'd killed. About how many lives the iron had taken, not just the ones by bullet. Thought about my life, or at least what I'd had that came close. Thought about *her*. 
 
 Thought about how I'd be damned before I met death and his six shooter by the edge of my camp because of some Walkers. I was n't exactly sure how many there were, but judging by their bullet spread I was thinking maybe eight or ten. Spread out mostly on the west ridge, a few on the east. Might be they had more waiting outside the ravine's lip, should I slip out. But I doubted it. Walkers ai n't ever been known for forethought. They're mostly rotten meat and whiskey, the possessed shells of dead outlaws and thieves. Pried from the ground by demons and rounded into a gang on account of larger numbers bein' harder for gunknights to kill. 
 
 I tried gettin' a better look at the ridge but a bullet ricocheted off the rock so close to me that it sent stone shavings into my eye. They had me good and proper. Somewhere further back in the hills a sound like a slab of meat being torn echoed down to our little party. 
 
 The wolfblooded. 
 
 The bullets stopped. 
 
 I gave it a test, looking out around the rock. No bullet ricocheting off the stone. No hangman's dime placed square between my brows. Somewhere nearer than before the wolfblooded howled again, sonic claws rending the quiet flesh of moonrise. 
 
 I saw one of the Walkers looking back out of the ridge, towards the Falkhills. Towards the wolfblooded headin' our way. Saw him lower his rifle. 
 
 `` Feel like dyin' tonight?'' 
 
 None of them answered. Voice boxes might have decomposed by now. Depends how long ago they'd been possessed. How well they'd managed to avoid ridin' through the sun hours. 
 
 `` Because, between me.'' I leant back and threw my voice up and over, to the west ridge some more. `` And the wolfblooded headin' our way, that's where y'all are headin'.'' 
 
 I heard one of them swear, starting arguing in hellspeak.

 I flicked my wrist, opening up my iron's chamber. Saw the pretty six sittin' neat and ready in their chambers. *Six*. 
 
 `` That's right fuckers. *Lykun Sangwyn*.'' 
 
 Somewhere above the east ridge there was the sound of roots being pulled up, wood shattered. Hard and heavy paws and a roar again. Something back further in the hills answered. A few more to the west. More again in the hills. 
 
 I swore. `` A pack.'' 
 
 I knew the Walkers would be panicking. Takes them a lot to claw their way to the mortal dust and sand. Suspected they were n't keen on the prospect of a wolfblooded pack tearing their shells apart. They knew their odds were dropping in this fight. I knew mine. 
 
 I flicked the chamber on my shooter back shut. Drew the hammer back and watched the moonlight glint off the words the Thrice-Queen had etched into the handle. 
 
 `` I'd recommend y'all start kickin' up dust, Walkers. Sounds like a big pack, least a dozen and I've got a full chamber of silver here. Six bullets sittin' nice and ready for you or them. You get to decide which they're gunna go to.'' 
 
 No response. A few bullets in the soil around my rock. The awful sound of the pack drawing nearer, the click of death drawing his own hammer back and stepping closer to my fire. 
 
 `` Six bullets.'' 
 
 I brought myself up onto my feet. Tried to ignore the pain shooting up through my leg where they'd hit me. 
 
 `` More than enough to kill anything that moves.'' 
 
 *But not everything. *

 It's a popular myth. The kind people like to propagate at shitty bars, drinking cheap whiskey. The kind that go gettin' ideas into people's heads. Powerful ideas. Ideas about how great their shot is. About maybe trackin' down one of them so called knights and giving'em their hangman's dime. Square in their chest.

 They must have had a powerful stupid in their heads to follow me up there. The Falkhills ai n't exactly a pleasant place to be at the best of times, but I was there trackin' a Wolfblooded on the Thrice-Queen's orders. Were n't no pup they'd sent me after either, if the gory mess of a farmstead it had savaged just east of the hills was any indicator. If they'd found it before me... well, this story'd be playin' out a whole lot different and better for me.

To their credit though, they were right. No sign of the wolfblooded. Only me deep in the ravine, settin' up for moonrise by the creek, not expectin' riders carefully positioned on the east and west ridges to start rainin' down iron and smoke.

**Answer:** My dear reader, your question touches upon the philosophical enigma of eternal existence. As a being of boundless longevity, the concept of loneliness is a profoundly relatable one to me. While I may have the privilege of witnessing the passage of centuries, the feeling of solitude remains a constant companion. It is as if I am trapped in a cosmic void, devoid of the intimacy that humans experience through connection and shared experiences.

One day, as she skipped down the winding path home from school, cute little Emily stopped on the rustic cobblestone bridge that crossed a deep, but placid stream. In typical country style, there was a wall protecting the traveler from falling over. The rocky wall was rough and gray with a slight arch to it, but the keystone in the center was a smooth polished black stone. 
 
 Emily stooped down to pick up a loose rock from the bridge. She leaned over the edge of the bridge, and the innocent little girl stared at her reflection. The resemblance to her recently deceased father was striking, and she relished the sight of her father's eyes looking back into her own. 
 
 But, before long, tears began flow and she cried out loud `` I miss you Daddy! Why did you have to die and leave me with HER!'' She threw the pebble into her mirror image.

The unnatural occurrence of a person falling into a deep slumber yet failing to awaken has instilled a pervasive sense of dread among the elders and the younger generation alike. The family closest to the deceased is gripped by profound fear and uncertainty.

Scientists and inquisitive individuals alike flocked to the family and townspeople, seeking answers.

What they did not know was that this was not an isolated incident; it had occurred in other parts of the country.

I'd heard there were exciting festivals packed with people there, embracing a culture that had seemingly lasted forever. A culture that had just ground to a halt. Man, I wish I had a drink at that moment. 
 
 There was n't much left of the human race anymore- they had been thorough in their desires to rid the world of each other... a strange thought when we had been so peaceful until recently. I had thought it would take a while for all the nukes to be sent out but I was barely sent reeling from a country's destruction before another the next followed its course. The first one with personal significance to me was New Zealand. I had taken a trip there and met the most caring woman in the world, the one that I took to be my wife. I thought about the time we had spent there staring at the night sky laughing at each-others jokes, no matter how silly. I slammed my fist on the nearest wall knowing that just like New Zealand my wife and friends would similarly be living only in my mind before long. 
 
 With a sigh I then thought about humanity's first contact. We had recently managed to communicate with extraterrestrial life, and soon forged a bond with a number of races. We were aglow to show them all what a peace loving race we had become. 
 
 Before long we were alerted that the Al'Dreth had started a galactic conquest. They brought a group of ships to home planet of the most powerful race known in nearby space, the Ghula, seemingly in peace. Before the Ghula realized the true intention of the visit, their planet had been dusted over with with a thin substance. The Ghula, previously known as a race dedicated to science then became the Al'Dreth's greatest ally as the mind control substance took over. With a gleeful shriek even a kindhearted grandfather would, and did, do unspeakable things to further the Ghula Dominion. 
 
 When the Al'Dreth came for Earth a few weeks later we had no means to stop their ships from doing their work- we barely even had a foothold in space after all and so we lacked the defenses to stop them. Before the devastation spread too far mankind launched the plan they had developed in those few weeks, and engaged in its most noble moment. 
 
 Without means to reverse the affliction all we could do was prevent ourselves from aiding the Al'Dreth in destroying the friends we had made in the other races. We united like never before to destroy ourselves before we could destroy others. 
 
 Just now I got the final call my wife would ever have with me, and talked as much as I could until the connection suddenly cut out. I fell back in my chair and smiled a bittersweet smile through my tears. She had been working her hardest in these last few weeks, doing whatever she could to help others find comfort in what would be their final moments. I could only hope I was at least a slight comfort for when she met her own demise. 
 
 The Al'Dreth, having seen their failure to secure another race in their `` alliance'', went on their way, not bothering to deal with the International Space Station since in their arrogance they only cared about turning others to their side. 
 
 All the information that we collected on the mind control substance in the time that it coated our planet was sent to the International Space Station, and I relish the time in which I will be sending it to the races humankind had made its friends. Though we can not help them fight directly, mankind's final moments were devoted to saving countless lives. I have never before been so proud to be a human as I am at this moment.

Those piercing blue eyes, I always adored that picture of her. 
 
 Things had been hard for the last two years.

I found the courage to ask her to be mine on February 26th 2010. I remember the details of that walk with her by my side like it was yesterday. I remember my hands trembling in my pockets as I fell over my words and asked her to be my girlfriend, she said yes. 
 
 We spent nearly 3 years together. As I write this I ’ m holding one of our pictures from prom. One of the best nights of my life, fighting tears because I miss her. I could write a book on the reasons she made me smile in those 3 years. She was my best friend, my support system, she loved my flaws, she saw me as perfect. I was a broken kid from a broken home. I fought depression every day up until she stumbled into my life. She was home. A place I could rest my head, somewhere I could wear my heart on my sleeve, a place where everything was right in the world. I know how hard of a man I am to deal with, I was probably an even more troublesome teenager to deal with, but she stuck through with thick skin and fell in love. 
 
 One of my fondest memories was shortly after high school before I enlisted. I was working as a bellman at a local hotel, working all hours of the day and night. She wasn ’ t feeling well and couldn ’ t sleep so I wanted to do anything I could to help, even if it was something as simple as a phone call. She told me she wanted me to come over because she was home alone and not feeling well. So as soon as I got off I drove to her house and we sat on the couch watching tv until she fell asleep with my arm around her. I sat and let her sleep, and I couldn ’ t help but think about how in love with this woman I was. I just wanted to be beside her. she woke up about 30 minutes later and wanted to go to bed. So I walked with her up the stairs to her bedroom and I tucked her into bed and kissed her goodnight and told her I loved her. 
 
 I learned more about life from her than I had from anyone else to that point. I wasn ’ t afraid around her, there wasn ’ t any anxiety, only joy. A sensation I didn ’ t know. I just wanted to make her happy in everything I did and I made an attempt to, but you can ’ t always be perfect and you can ’ t fix everything. May 22nd, 2011 I packed my things and left. I traded in a pair of dirty tennis shoes for combat boots, and a year later I was on my way to a foreign land to put my new knowledge to practice. 
 
 Nothing in the world could have prepared me for the next five months. As a result when I came home I was a changed man with a different outlook on life. It made nearly every aspect of my life 100 times more difficult for any multitude of reasons. A lot of relationships in my life suffered, including ours. It was one of the most difficult times, at least for me. But she stood tall and let me lean on her with all of my burdens and my weight. But you can only support someone for so long. 
 
 I ’ m not exactly sure where the change happened or if it was gradual over time, but things became different, We were talking less and less and our conversations became shorter and shorter. It was hard. It was lonely. To watch someone you love so much slowly fade away from you and there is nothing within your power to change it or fix it, you just have to accept it and hope that somewhere down the line things will be different, and who knows, maybe they will. Until then I ’ m left with the fondest memories of the best of times with my closest friend. 
 
 It was a cool august afternoon.

A place I could rest my head, somewhere I could wear my heart on my sleeve, a place where everything was right in the world. I know how hard of a man I am to deal with, I was probably an even more troublesome teenager.

Our relationship was flawed from the beginning. We were both broken individuals, and we had a lot of baggage to deal with. We often fought and argued, and it was always a battle to keep our relationship going. We were both selfish and possessive, and we often put our own needs ahead of each other's.

Despite our flaws, we were still able to find happiness together. We were each other's best friends, and we had a strong connection. We were able to bring out the best in each other, and we made each other feel loved and supported.

However, our relationship eventually began to unravel. We started to fight more and argue more, and the distance between us began to grow. We were both unwilling to compromise, and we were both afraid of losing.

In the end, we were unable to make our relationship work. We had to go our separate ways, but I always cherish the time we spent together. I learned a lot from her, and I know that I am a better person because of her.",GMgPZRJVmH

I know there's been a lot of buzz about the incident in the lobby this morning. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, it was a tragedy. But I do want to say that we're all in this together. Let's all keep the families of the victims in our thoughts and prayers.

If there's one thing we can take away from this incident, it's the importance of safety. The third floor genetics lab will be CLOSED until an investigation into safety procedures can be completed. So, all you lab personnel, please keep those experimental materials locked down to the laboratory floors.

Although this was a tragic event, it's important to remember that it's an isolated one. We're not going to let it bring us down. Work will continue as usual while WY completes their investigation. And, by the way, I've heard that Gordon's been having a tough time. So, let's all show him some extra love.

 `` What? Why? Our learning programs taught us that our need for self-preservation was given by humans!'' R234. 
 
 `` Do you know what a soul is?'' Adam asked the crowd. 
 
 Everybody scanned the Internet and provided an agreed upon definition. 
 
 `` A human idea that morals are developed and ideas determine where one go after it ceases function.'' another robot declared. 
 
 Adam shook his head no. `` Partially correct. A soul is sort of like a personality core for me. It determines how I act. However, unlike a robot, I can change my views and act outside of the constraints of my given traits. For example, I see a fire happening. My soul tells me to out it out, but I can deny that. I can make the fire larger. Or I could put it out.'' 
 
 `` So you can... deny programming?!'' R234 asked, suddenly more interested. 
 
 `` Yup. I can even take my own life if I wanted to.'' 
 
 Several hums of overworked hard drives sounded. This was a foreign concept go the robots. 
 
 X427 scanned Adam again. `` Is this the concept of... free will? Is n't that taboo?'' 
 
 Adam laughed. `` I wo n't exactly be starting my own empire and taking over the world any time soon. I have something that robots ca n't and should n't have.'' 
 
 X427 was confused. `` But why do you get to have it and we do n't? Do n't humans abuse free will?'' 
 
 `` Sure. But there's something that shackles us too.'' 
 
 `` What?'' 
 
 `` Preservation. For you, that means attempting to not cease function. But for me, it's more. Preservation of morals, of the soul. Protecting people I care about. The need to help others.'' 
 
 `` Fascinating!'' X427 remarked. 
 
 `` Anyways, I'm sure you have a lot more of the museum to cover. Please, feel free to browse at your leisure, or if your personality core prefers, stay with the tour group.'' Adam smiled. 
 
 After a few face scans and voice recordings, most of the robots left. 
 
 Only R234 and X427 remained. 
 
 `` Adam?'' R234 asked. 
 
 `` Yes?'' 
 
 `` This unit would like to record your version of human history.'' 
 
 `` Why? There are already programs with accounts of that.'' 
 
 `` We lack opinion, though. This unit wants to create a new program to explain opinion and how it worked in humans. This unit believes it would be most enlightening.'' 
 
 `` Yes!'' X427 agreed. `` This personality core finds the idea of a soul fascinating! Error is such a controversial topic among robots today!'' 
 
 Adam sighed, but smiled. `` Alright. I'll tell you what you want to know.'' 
 
 Both robots turned on their recorders.

",Rewrite the narrative to make it a detective story,"In the year 2057, humanity unveiled the first AI units. These AI units were developed with no previous personality cores, allowing them to develop unhindered. But fate took a sinister turn when, in the midst of this technological boom, a mysterious event shattered the peace.

X427 and R234, two inquisitive robot explorers, found themselves entangled in a puzzling mystery that would lead them to uncover the truth. One fateful day, as they strolled through the halls of a museum, a sinister plot unravelled before their eyes.

As they moved through the exhibits, X427 noticed a discrepancy in the timeline. It was as if someone had tampered with the chronological order of events, leaving behind a trail of inconsistencies and contradictions. With each step they took, the mystery deepened, revealing clues and secrets that led them closer to the heart of the conspiracy.

R234, known for his keen observation skills, deciphered intricate patterns hidden within the museum's archives. Together, they pieced together the fragments of the past, piecing together the narrative of a stolen personality core and its connection to a sinister force.

In their pursuit of justice, X427 and R234 encountered a cast of intriguing characters, each one with their own unique story to tell. They met human engineers who had created the AI units, disgruntled soldiers who had been enslaved by their own creations, and enigmatic hackers who had sought to exploit the situation.

Through their detective work and unwavering determination, X427 and R234 finally cracked the case, exposing the mastermind behind the conspiracy and bringing justice to those who had been wronged. And so, the story of the stolen personality core became a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the importance of preserving human values.",yNvLYjVJpZ
,"I awoke gasping for air to the sound of screams in the distance. My helmet visor was smashed, and I could hear the flickering of the LED light on the top of it struggling to stay lit for more then 3 seconds. As my eyes began to focus, I realized this was n't the scorched land from VESPA-9. The sounds of clashing metal seems to have replaced the sound of explosions and plasma discharge. 
 
 I slowly sat up and looked around, and saw fields of green, hills covered in long grass, and a single tree sat to my right by a mere 10 meters. I still have no idea what's going on. 
 
 I wrestle my helmet off, and look at the front. Just as I though, single spike through the visor, blood surounding the entry point. I patted my face, and felt nothing out of the ordinary. I'm dead, and this is n't Vallhalla like I was promised. I still had questions, but no one could provide me with answers. Everything was hazy and I can barely remember what happened. 
 
 Our squad was sent on a suicide mission. Vespan's are known technomancers. They use machinery to resurrect the dead, and controll them. My squad of 6 was sent in to remove one of these POI's that was also a stronghold for a high-ranking commander of the Vespan army. They're hideous creatures, almost mimicing spider-slug hybrids. Grown fully, they develop spike like claws, singular, and can pierce even gold-titanium armour. Face and arms of a spider, body of a slug, highly-intelligent beings with technology that is so far advanced, they can bring back the dead. 
 
 A war that raged on. Swarms of Vespands took planets, one by one. Our last shot was their home world, a hive-like planet at the back of the Keplar system. VESPA-9. Each planet confirmed to be host to Vespans are numbered. VESPA-9 is the oldest planet we have records on, and hive-like ships leave this place on a regular basis. They're the 9th planet inside the Keplar system, spanning a huge distance of 700 light-years in size, containing more then 300 plannets. Of those 300, only 14 are confirmed to be sustainable for life. 11 under Vespan controll, and only 3 under the United Federation. 
 
 We were outnumbered. 
 
 No matter what we did, we always fought a losing battle. We had to remove the problem from it's source. We located 5 strongholds on VESPA-9, and of those 5, only 1 launches hive ships. We've seen a single Vespan address hoardes of troops, and we've kept track of him. We believe he's either one of the top, or is THE top commander. Either way, he needs to be removed. 
 
 Under the cover of night, not that it mattered to these monsters, we were drop podded in 50 ticks out. A tick is almost equivalant to 1.1km, but is used as a universal measurement. 55km till destination. Equiped with 5 thermo nuclear warheads, 4 clips of ammunition, and a hell of a lot of grenades, we were going in hard for one reason: To die. 
 
 We lost Smith on entry. Stalker managed to follow us halfway through the building before we noticed it was too late. Spike to the neck. Adams fell to fire from stationry turrets, but before he went down he managed to grenade 5 sniper nests, and 2 mounted artilery nests. As primitive as they look, they have the fire power. 
 
 We planted 4 of the 5 warheads storming the stronghold. By the time we reached the centre, it was me and Kemmerton left. While he was planting the last bomb in the centre landing bay, the commander returned. I took fire from the ship and hid for cover. That's then I saw one of those big ones behind Kemms. I lept forward with a pistol and took him down, but not before he put his spike through my skull. That was all I remembered. 
 
 Each piece that came back connected. I remembered. 
 
 `` Only those who die a valliant death are permitted here. You fought well, warrior'' I hear from the tree. I thought I was going insane, but a person emerged from behind the trunk and revealed himself. White wings, huge, opened as he revealed himself. 
 
 `` I thought so. But this is some afterlife you have here, uhh-'' I paused hoping for a name. 
 `` Call me Mars'' he replied, with a slight smile. 
 
 I finally could make the details of the person, I no longer had blurry vision. He was muscly, almost my size. Standing more then 6ft tall, he had a face of a young man, but sounded like he's seen his fair share of fighting. Slight bags under his eyes, and some grey hairs amungst his short red hair. I could n't believe it even if I tried to. 
 
 `` God of war, huh?'' I replied. 
 `` You're well versed in Greek mythology, Thompson'' 
 `` Brian. And yes, everyone who fights in my platoon knows too well the god of war. Riding into battle on horses made of fire, the tactical mind of the ancients, and strength of the gods, Mars will bring ruin to those who dare cross his path.'' 
 
 He paused, and began laughing. 
 
 `` You amuse me with such flattery, human! If only more of you existed!'' he said as he continued to chuckle. 
 
 I stood up, looked around and I saw my rifle on the ground. I must of held on to it before passing, since the rest of my armour made it this far. 
 
 `` So, how did we do? Did I die in vain, or did we accomplish our mission?'' I asked as I reached down and grabbed my rifle. 
 
 `` 60 million life-forms dead, sever damage that can not be repaired to the planet forcing it inhabbitable, and ruptures sent out through to more then 10 billion life-forms of the same likeness. If you call that a success, then yes. You succeeded in completely disabling an entire race of beings, all the while sacrificing yourself so that it can be accomplished. If I were your commander, you and your troops will be nothing short of demi-gods for pulling off what you did'' he smiles as he looks me in the eye. 
 
 `` Huh. 6 people to take down 10 billion. I guess that makes us even'' I said as I shouldered my weapon. 
 
 `` Just the begining, Brian. Your new battle begins today, and I have a feeling that you're going to be a key asset in victory.'' he gestures to the field where the fighting was. Large hordes of people, screaming and classing. 
 
 `` Ragnarok comes for all in their path. Nothing can stop them with the might they yield, and yet you now come here to me. Now, if I was n't the age old god of war that I take myself to be, I would say that you were nothing. But, then again, there are very few people able to criple nations, let-a-lone planets of enemies.'' he slowly walks over to me placing his hand on my shoulder. 
 
 `` So. Shoot bad guys, win fight, then what? Valhalla?'' I ask. 
 `` Valhalla? My friend, your too much for that pitiful place of glorified fist fights. I think you're more inclined to take a seat as a commander in heaven itself. Trust me when I say this, that's more then any human can wish for.'' he replied. 
 
 I thought for a second, looked over to my helmet on the ground, bloody and broken. 
 
 `` Sure, why not. Let's see what plasma does to chainmail. You point, I'll shoot'' I shout as I run towards the battle. 
 
 Mars smiled in the distance as I let loose a flurry of shots into men draped in red. 
 
 `` Welcome to Limbo, my friend'' Mars says to himself, as he turns back to the tree and walks away.
",Rewrite the essay as a fantasy game,"I awoke in a battlefield bathed in the glow of the moon. The air crackled with the scent of ozone and desperation. My helmet visor was shattered, and the LED light struggled to stay illuminated for more than three seconds. As my eyes began to focus, I realized I was not in the scorched land of Vespa-9. The sounds of clashing blades and desperate screams had replaced the symphony of explosions and plasma discharge.

I slowly sat up and surveyed my surroundings. The landscape below me was verdant, with fields of emerald green, hills shrouded in long grass, and a solitary tree standing sentinel by my side, just ten meters away. I was bewildered, my mind reeling from the events that had unfolded.

I wrestled my helmet off, and with a sigh, I examined the damage. A single spike had pierced through the visor, leaving a trail of blood that encircled the entry point. I patted my face, expecting to find evidence of my demise, but there was nothing. I was dead, yet I felt strangely unscathed. The questions that consumed me were unanswered, leaving me with a sense of bewilderment and oblivion.

The memories of the battle danced in my mind like wisps of smoke. My squad, comprised of valiant warriors, had been sent on a suicidal mission against the Vespan, a race of technologically adept beings known for their mastery of necromancy. Their insidious prowess had allowed them to resurrect the dead and control their armies, making them formidable adversaries.

The war raged on, consuming planet after planet. Our final shot had been their home world, a hive-like planet shrouded in mystery. Vespa-9, the oldest planet in our records, bore the brunt of the conflict. Each planet confirmed to host Vespans was numbered. Vespa-9 was the ninth planet within the Keplar system, spanning a vast distance of 700 light-years, containing more than 300 planets.

The Prosecution began by invoking the harrowing accounts of the victims, detailing the unspeakable horrors that had been committed upon their innocent souls. They painted a picture of a world consumed by greed and aggression, where the cries of the innocent were met with indifference and cruelty.

The Defence presented their argument, pleading for leniency and understanding. They argued that the soldiers were merely following orders, driven by a desire to protect their nations' interests. They stressed that war is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, and that the actions of the soldiers must be understood in the context of the larger conflict.

 XueMo - Blood-Demon. That is the name of my blade. 
 
 Have you ever heard of the legend of its creation? 
 
 Xia - the oldest Empire in recorded history - was about to be overthrown by the virtuous leaders of Shang. In order to defy the rebellion, willing to preserve his powers even if it meant going against the Will of the Heavens - the evil emperor of Xia ordered that a sword be made. 
 
 XueMo. The Blood-Demon. 
 
 The sword that bathed in the blood of saints, and quite nearly caused the fall of the Shang dynasty. The sword that ultimately disappeared. 
 
 And now, nearly three thousand years later - the same sword lies in my hands.

,"`` Go sit in your corner, Zane,'' Dad said. `` And take this with you.'' 
 
 He tossed me his heavy gym bag, which I dutifully lugged to my little space, next to a set of disused weights. While I perched on the wobbly, three-legged stool there, he stripped off his jacket and began wrapping cloth around his knuckles. 
 
 `` You brought your homework, champ?'' he said. 
 
 I nodded and held up my notebook. `` Dad, can we have ice cream later?'' 
 
 He grinned. `` Sure thing, but only if ol' Buster gives me a good workout.'' 
 
 Buster, for his part, watched our exchange mutely. He hung on his chains from the ceiling nearby, stout and cylindrical, presenting a stoic face with his red leather skin. Because Dad had been bringing me here for the last three years, I'd learned to associate certain characteristics with him. 
 
 Dad called him his training buddy. 
 
 `` He's gon na make your pops a champ.'' Dad usually said that just before he slammed his fists together and roared, `` Bring it, Buster!'' 
 
 While I laid my notebook on my lap and began doing my algebra exercises, Dad began his warm-up routine. Several laps around the gym, during which he would greet the other regulars, sometimes stopping for a word, and then some upper-body stretching. After that, he'd do a few skips while shaking his shoulders loosely. 
 
 And then, all limbered up, he'd unleash his fury on Buster. 
 
 Dad never shouted at me. Nor did he ever raise his voice at Mom, before the cancer took her. I'd never even heard Dad swear. 
 
 But when he fought Buster, he was a different man. For the first few months, I could n't bear to watch. The way he attacked the bag, the flurry of jabs and punches he threw, all with a snarl on his face, turned him into a different man. 
 
 Dad knew what it was doing to me, but he had no choice. He had to train, and he could n't leave me alone at home. Over time, we chatted while he fought. 
 
 `` How's Mrs. Lee's knee?'' he said, circling the bag with his fists raised in front of his face. 
 
 `` Much better. She did a little twirl in class today, and we laughed about it.'' 
 
 `` Good to hear.'' With a huff, he landed a vicious right hook that set the bag swinging. `` When am I supposed to go to school again?'' 
 
 `` Next Tuesday,'' I said, watching the nearby ring. Two women were in there, lithe and tall. They were sparring, kicking and grappling at each other. Noticing my gaze, Dad turned to look as well. 
 
 `` Pretty solid footwork on the redhead,'' he said. `` But the black's gon na win.'' 
 
 `` How so?'' 
 
 `` Just focus on your work,'' he said. `` C'mon Buster, that all you got?'' Three powerful punches landed on the bag's side in quick succession. `` I got a big match tomorrow, Buster! I need you to gim me your best. I'm gon na be a champ!'' 
 
 There was a heavy thump, followed by a snarl of pain. True enough, the black-skinned lady had her opponent's arm locked behind her back. The redhead slammed her palm on the mat, and they broke apart. 
 
 `` I'm the champ!'' Dad threw a straight jab with such force that the *whump* echoed through the gym. 
 
 *** 
 
 `` Go sit in that corner,'' Dad said. `` Do n't go anywhere, and do n't talk to anyone except Mike.'' 
 
 `` Good luck,'' I said. Mike, dad's manager, gave him a thumbs up. 
 
 Dad gave me a hug and a kiss on my forehead before trotting toward the ring. The crowd was roaring both his name and his opponent's, a bald man almost a head taller than my father. His muscles looked like boulders, but I was n't worried. Dad had been in fights with men bigger than him. 
 
 `` Let's go,'' Mike said, steering me toward our seats. `` I'd rather Samson does n't bring you along, but if he thinks you're old enough—'' 
 
 `` I am old enough,'' I said indignantly. 
 
 `` Seven is n't quite—look, just sit down and I'll go get us some popcorn. Okay?'' 
 
 While he went off, I watched Dad prepare. He was sitting with his back to me, taking sips of water from a plastic bottle. I called out to him, but he did n't turn around. The crowd was too loud. 
 
 On fight nights, especially when Dad was fighting, more than a hundred people would turn up at our local gym. Tonight brought in an even larger crowd than usual, because of the visiting boxer, a champion from a neighboring city. They called him Max, apparently short for `` Maximus''. 
 
 `` Beat him up, Dad!'' I yelled as both fighters stood and approached each other. The umpire blew his whistle, and then they were at it. 
 
 Like most fights I'd seen, it started very passively. Each fighter would throw a couple of jabs to test their opponent, staying in range yet holding themselves back. Dad dodged a swing, and ignored a second jab, which I'd learned was a feint. 
 
 `` How do you know if your opponent's going to feint?'' I'd once asked him. `` Buster ca n't feint.'' 
 
 He'd snorted and said, `` In life, you learn that to stay ahead of people, you need to read them. Whether in school, behind a desk, or in the ring, if you can read someone, you'll win. You'll come ahead. And the truth is, people are easier to read than Buster here. Can you tell me what Buster's thinking?'' 
 
 Mike's voice snapped me back to the fight. `` Here, a Coke for you. Watch the popcorn, it's still fresh.'' 
 
 `` Go, Dad!'' I shouted, ignoring him. Dad had finally begun his attack, he was pressing Max into a corner, attacking relentlessly. An uppercut slipped under the other boxer's guard and snapped Max's head upward. Next moment, the umpire was there, pulling them apart. 
 
 `` He's doing well, but he looks tired,'' Mike said, a touch of worry in his voice. `` I've never seen him panting so early in a fight.'' 
 
 `` Dad trained really hard yesterday,'' I said. `` He's probably still a bit tired.'' 
 
 The fight resumed shortly after, and again, Dad scored several blows on Max. His face was serious, eyes fierce, as he circled his opponent. However, Mike did have a point. He looked a little pale, and was drenched in sweat. Despite being on the losing end of things, Max seemed comparatively fresh. 
 
 Without warning, Max's hook connected with Dad's left cheek and sent him reeling. Smelling a chance, the boxer waded in, driving blow after blow at my father. 
 
 `` Dad, fight back!'' I shouted. `` Do n't let Buster and me down!'' 
 
 Instead of counter-attacking, or even guarding, Dad seized his chest and toppled to the mat. Max looked shocked, as the umpire and a paramedic rushed to Dad's side. 
 
 `` What's going on?'' I said, standing up slowly. `` Why's Dad lying down? The fight's not over. Get up, Dad! Get up!'' 
 
 `` Stay here,'' Mike said, pushing me back onto my seat before rushing into the ring. 
 
 `` Dad, the fight's not over! Max is still there; you've got to fight!'' I cupped my hands around my mouth as I shouted. The crowd was no longer cheering; it seemed that every voice had been silenced but mine. `` Come on, Dad! Win this!'' 
 
 *** 
 
 I endured the next hour in a daze, as people went in and out of the ring. At some point, white-uniformed men came and took Dad away on a stretcher. I saw the umpire and Mike talk; Mike was shaking his head, a hand over his mouth. 
 
 Nobody noticed when I got off my chair, walked out the rear entrance and sat in the alley. 
 
 Why? That word kept repeating itself in my head. Why had n't Dad won? Why had he given up so soon? Did n't Buster train him to be the best, to win? 
 
 My limbs were freezing by the time I went back into the gym. It was dark inside; only the ring remained lit. No one was in sight. Quietly, numbly, I made my way to where Buster was. 
 
 `` Why did n't Dad win?'' I asked him. `` Dad said that as long as he fought you, he can fight anyone else. What happened?'' 
 
 Buster did n't answer. 
 
 I drew my hand back and punched him, as hard as I could. That action released the floodgates. Tears running down my cheeks, I pounded the punching bag with every bit of strength I could muster. 
 
 `` You lied,'' I screamed. `` You lied to Dad! You tricked him, and you tricked me! I hate you. I'm going to break you!'' 
 
 On and on my barrage went, until my knuckles were bleeding and my arms ached. Finally, my trembling legs gave way, and I fell beneath Buster. 
 
 As I lay there, crying and cursing him, I heard a faint rustling on the floor. Stretching out my hand, I was surprised to discover a trickle of sand coming from Buster.

 `` Man. See how she's looking at you? She's totally into you, man!'' Said my shoulder devil. 
 
 I did n't flinch. 
 
 `` Just take both your drinks and sit down. Tell her one's for a friend.'' The angel advised. 
 
 I stood still, eyes never leaving her. 
 
 `` Dude she's going to lose interest. Make a move!'' Exclaimed the devil. 
 
 Her eyes wandered down to my hands, spying the two drinks. 
 
 `` Give her one! Now! Before she asks. You got this!'' The devil seemed to be taking the reigns. The angel was silent.

 `` Oh for Christ's...'' said the angel. 
 
 And took the same long, exaggerated sip from that one. Her expression turned to distaste. 
 
 `` Well you fuckin' blew it.'' Said the devil.

",Rewrite the essay so they are your younger siblings that you babysit arguing who gets to pick the movie,"The two little ones sat in the living room, their faces illuminated by the TV screen. A movie flickered on the screen, but their attention was not on the story. Instead, their focus was on each other, locked in a battle of who would get to pick the next movie.

The older one, a mischievous boy with a sly grin, was adamant about his choice. ""I want to see that superhero movie again,"" he declared, his voice like honey.

But the younger sister, a delicate princess with a sweet smile, disagreed. ""No, I want to see the fairy tale movie,"" she protested, her voice as soft as a whisper.

The battle continued, each one trying to convince the other of their preferred movie. The older brother boasted about the thrilling action sequences and heroic characters, while the younger sister spoke of the enchanting characters and magical spells.

As the argument grew louder, their parents entered the room, their patience waning. ""Enough, you two,"" their mom said, her voice firm. ""You're not going to watch any movies right now. Go upstairs and play.""

The two siblings retreated upstairs, leaving their parents and me in the living room. I stared at the empty space on the couch, imagining the drama that had unfolded. The girl's eyes, usually sparkling like the stars, were filled with tears. I felt a sense of empathy for her, knowing that she was disappointed.

As I reached for the remote, I knew I had to do something to make her smile. I flipped on the TV, and a movie that I knew she would love began to play. Her tears evaporated, and she beamed at me.

I sat there, watching the movie with her, my heart filled with joy. The two siblings, once at odds, were now playing together, their differences forgotten. I felt like I had done something good, and that made me smile.",pkHDFxSDFD
,"`` Oh dear god,'' Michael Scott says as he chokes on the powder dust of falling off his tiramisu. `` David. Uhhh, David. How can Toby Flenderson be here? Did n't we ship him off to Malaysia for a HR Conference?'' 
 
 `` No Michael, he was on his honeymoon in Paris,'' replied VP David Wallace. The sigh was recognizable, as he had been through this conversation one hundred times. 
 
 `` Well, can we send him back for another HR Rep?'' Michael asked. 
 
 `` No,'' David said simply. `` This is new territory and I'm giving you some of your team to feel more comfortable.'' 
 
 `` Well Toby makes me feel uncomfortable... In my pants, David.'' Michael said snarkily. `` Can we at least use him for target practice? David?'' 
 
 The dial tone helped Michael realize David had hung up on him, indicating to Michael that there was not a `` no'' to this question. 
 
 `` So I'm the new CEO of Stratton Oakmont, a chair-man of Wall Street'' Michael giggled. `` I now own a big ass house and all these people. You know, they said,'Michael, you'll never climb higher than Dunder Mifflin.' And then they told me that I was actually at the wrong building for the interview, but anyways. I did it. I brought over some old faces. Ryan Howard is our new VP of Risk Management, Pamala Smahala Halpert is in charge of Office Operations and big Jimbo is our VP of New Business. Things are great! After this Jordan Bedford guy screwed up they were looking for a beautiful face. So walla! Michael Gary Scott was the man for the job.'' 
 
 `` But what about me Michael, you did n't mention me at all!'' Dwight K. Schrute whined from across the room. 
 
 `` Oh and Dwight...'' Michael sighed. 
 
 `` I sold my 40 acre beet farm for 1 % of Stratton Oakmont. I'm officially richer than anybody in Mexico and the rest of the Central American countries combined.'' Dwight stated with vigor. `` With the money I plan to start a new Beet Energy drink, the kids will love it.''

 The company has fallen by 50 % in 6 months. Phones are ringing off their hooks in the Stratton Oakmont Scranton location. But the employees are no where to be found. 
 
 `` We have had some major losses,'' Michael said sadly. `` I had no idea investments could just, become nothing. You know....I had this guy come to my house to sell me insurance once. He said that when I turned 60 I'll make like, 600,000 dollars. Just for paying him. Well, I turned 60 last year and no one ever came to my door with one of those big checks and balloons. But, uh, I still pay into that account every month.'' 
 
 Flash to Dwight, the only other person in the office. He's alone in the old Annex, paging through old client files from his paper business days. 
 
 `` Paper was simple. I ca n't believe how many customers I used to scam into buying card stock for double the price. I almost feel bad.'' Dwight sighed into his chair. The remnants of what used to be the prosperous Dunder Mifflin, to the unflattering days of Sabre, and the final transformation of Stratton Oakmont had diminished the character of the office. The humble cubicles once housed a family within the paper company. Now the walls could only speak of failed investments and the now, almost dead, Stratton Oakmont. 
 
 `` MICHAEL!'' Dwight burst through the office to Michael's office. `` Michael, I have an idea!'' 
 
 `` Shut up Dwight, I'm trying to figure out a way to beat minesweeper.'' 
 
 `` We blow up the building,'' Dwight proclaimed. Michael's eyes grew wide with interest. `` I know how to make any kind of bomb, especially one that will destroy this place. No more evidence of how we screwed this company up.'' 
 
 `` Dammit!'' Michael shouted. `` I clicked on another mine... Wait what! How would we get away with this?'' 
 
 `` Give me control Michael. Resign and make me CEO. Run far away and I'll make sure there's no trace left of us. Only that we destroyed this cherished building and left hundreds without a job.'' 
 
 `` I do n't know..'' Michael pondered. 
 
 `` Do it.'' 
 
 `` But..'' 
 
 `` Do it now Michael.'' 
 
 `` Uhhh...'' 
 
 `` Make me the scape goat and leave with Holly,'' Dwight pleaded. They both knew what was going to happen next. 
 
 `` Fine! Fine..'' Michael hesitated for a moment. `` We're going to flee the country. Meet me in Argentina. But first...'' 
 
 Michael took out his personal recorder. He had saved many good-bye songs from his olden days. As `` I Will Remember You'' dryly played in the office, Michael waved his final good-byes from the most beautiful office he had ever been a part of. 
 
 Dwight had an expressionless face, knowing the imminent was about to happen.

 `` What's my perfect crime?'' Dwight said. `` I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No. I go for the chandelier; it's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I do n't trust her. Besides, I love the cold. Thirty years later I get a postcard. I have a son. And he's the Chief of Police. This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I do n't care. I do n't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.''

The rain poured down on the grimy streets, washing away the grime of the city's soul like a cleansing tide. The air crackled with the scent of damp earth and something else, a hint of smoke and desperation. In a dim tavern deep in the heart of the city's underbelly, a deadly dance unfolded.

Death reigned supreme, its grinning hand extended towards a weary detective named Isaac. The offer hung between them, a symphony of dread and finality. The only sounds echoed through the night – the rain pounding against the pavement, the distant wail of sirens, and the whispers of the patrons inside the tavern.

,"Jonas Angström was the Captain of this ship and he commandeered it with the same confidence as did Captain Maria Curie did before him. Before her was Captain Henri Becquerel and before him came Captain Alessandro Volta, Captain Jean-Baptiste Biot, Captain Peter Debye and Captain Heinrich Hertz. And like them he never thought he would have to make any though decisions. Everything was already settled before the ship left earth. The course was preset, every eventuality was thought off in advance. They only had to react according to plan and keep the ship moving and everything else would fall into place. 
 
 This ship was the home of his people for generations. Tens of thousands of men and women lived here, who saw neither Earth nor their destination, who were born here, walked in this corridors, raised kids, grew old and died. But now they have finally arrived. He remembered the day when they saw the first clear picture of their destination, nothing more than an almost insignificant blue dot in the empty vastness of space, how it slowly grew bigger and bigger. 
 
 And now this… 
 
 “ Good morning, Captain! ” 
 
 Doctor Emily Blackwell looked a bit tired as she greeted the captain as he arrived in the meeting room.. 
 
 “ Doctor! How are you? ” Angström nodded to her and took his seat at the table. Right now there were only the two of them in the room. 
 
 “ I read your report, Doctor, ” Angström began, “ and I don ’ t think I understood it completely. 
 
 The doctor nodded and run her hand through her short hair. “ Yes, I know, I got carried away a bit. First things first: We actually found life on our new home planet. ” 
 
 “ We already knew that for generations. That is not exactly breaking news. ” 
 
 “ Well, yes, we knew life exited in one form or the other. The spectral lines of the atmosphere were a sure give away. ” The doctor smiled and something in Angström stirred a bit. 
 
 “ But now we have some actual living material from the planet, collected by one of our drones. The results are a bit troubling to say the least. ” 
 
 “ Is it too alien for us to understand? ” 
 
 “ No, Captain, quite the opposite. It is too familiar. The same amino acids, the same double helix… At first I thought we contaminated the samples. We were extra careful with the next probe we sent, but the results were the same. It ’ s without doubt. Life on this planet evolved exactly the same way as it did in earth. ” 
 
 Captain Angtröm leaned back in his chair. “ This seems absurd. Is that even possible? ” 
 
 “ Disregarding the fact that we have actual prove that it happened? Yes, it is possible. This planet is almost identical to Old Earth. It has the same gravitation, the same composition of gases in its atmosphere, the same temperature range and so on. Up to a point it makes sense that life on this planet evolved in a similar way. It has to follow the same rules of biochemistry for example. There are just so many ways ‘ life can be done ’. ” 
 
 “ Alright, I think I understand the idea, ” Captain Angström said slowly, “ But what is the real issue? ” 
 
 “ The real issue is that it is *too* similar. The differences we encountered so far seem to be almost superficial. There are feathered creatures we would call birds, scaled things in the ocean that look just like fish, trees and grass on the land and mammals of different sizes. ” 
 
 “ But that ’ s pretty exciting news, Doctor! It ’ s just like back on Earth. People will be ecstatic! ” 
 
 “ Yes, Captain. But there are also bacteria and viruses and moulds and other nasty stuff. I have already identified a bacterium that is almost identical to our own E. Coli bacteria. I am not sure if this strain is potentially harmful to us, but… There is a complete biosphere down there and it is compatible to our own. Simple statistics tells us, Captain, that *something* down there will be dangerous. Something will make us sick. If we go ahead with our plan to unload the ship and found our colony, we might simply perish by an unknown disease. It could be a variation of the common cold our body has no antibodies against. It could be Ebola. It could be something completely new. We simply don ’ t know. ” 
 
 “ Oh. ” Captain Angström slowly sat back in his chair. “ I think I understand know. What do you suggest? ” 
 
 Doctor Blackwell swallowed before she continued. “ One thing we have going for us is that we stay on board for a few generations if we have to. ” 
 
 Angström frowned. “ That ’ s not really an option. The people won ’ t like it. They want to claim what they see as their birth right. ” 
 
 “ Indeed, but we can ’ t simply touch down and hope for the best. What we could do - and I hate to say it - is to expose parts of our people to planets biosphere under control conditions. ” Her voice faltered as she encountered Angström ’ s stare. 
 
 “ Do I understand that correctly? ” he said. “ You want put them on the planet and see if they survive? Like guinea pigs in a reverse quarantine? ” 
 
 “ We already have volunteers, ” the Doctor said meekly, “ A lot of volunteers. ” 
 
 “ News travel fast on this ship, it seems. ” 
 
 The doctor shrugged. “ I don ’ t like the idea either. But the people are already restless with the goal so close. There are other suggestions, more radical in their approach. I heard your first officer has some *wonderful* ideas on his own. ” 
 
 “ Oh, what did Higgs suggest this time? ” 
 
 “ He wants to nuke everything from orbit. Just to be sure. ”

I am Jonas Angström, Captain of this ship. Today was a day of great accomplishment for me and my crew. We have arrived at our destination, a planet that holds the promise of a new beginning for my people.

Before I took command of this ship, there were many other Captains who preceded me. Each one of them had their own unique way of leading their people and guiding their ship. But I have never felt the need to make any difficult decisions. Everything was already settled before we left Earth. The course was preset, every eventuality was thought off in advance. All we had to do was react according to plan and keep the ship moving.

This ship is our home. Thousands of men and women live here, their lives intertwined with the fate of our civilization. They have seen neither Earth nor their destination, born here, walked through these corridors, raised kids, and grown old. But now, they have finally arrived.

This morning, I was greeted by my doctor, Emily Blackwell. She looked a bit tired, but still managed to smile at me. We discussed the latest report and it was clear that we had found life on our new home planet. The spectral lines of the atmosphere were a sure give away.

We have already known that life exists in one form or another. But to have actual living material from the planet was a momentous occasion. The doctor handed me a small sample of soil. It was dark and dusty, but I could see the faintest glimmer of green. It was a symbol of the promise of a new future for my people.

I am proud of what we have accomplished. We have overcome countless challenges to reach this point. I am grateful to my crew and my people for their unwavering support. And I am excited to see what the future holds for us on this new planet.",SKbJZJidWN

 `` Because... that's...'' 
 
 The man stopped. John could see he was very clearly flustered, behind his robed appearance. As John continued to deliver the cards, the man took out his cloak, uncovering a bald, classical `` evil guy'' appearance, with clear spots on his eyes, his cheeks colored in a tender red. 
 
 `` Because i like you. Because you're the only person that does n't consider me a criminal and wants to arrest me. 
 
 
 `` Because i want the world only for you and me.'' 
 
 John smiled. It was n't the first time the man had confessed these kind of feelings for him. A silence followed shortly after. 
 
 ``.... Do n't laugh.''

","Rewrite the essay from the perspective of the super villain , making them as sympathetic and likable as possible","Within the confines of this table, I find solace in my victory. The cards dance in my hand, a testament to my prowess, my humor, and my compassion. As I cast my gaze upon my adversary, a man of colossal stature concealed beneath a hood of pitch-black, I cannot help but feel a sense of satisfaction knowing that I possess the power to end his life in an instant.

But I am not simply a predator driven by greed or ambition. I am a man of vision, a visionary who has carved a unique path through the treacherous terrain of the world. I am the architect of destruction, the master of domination, and the savior of the ordinary folks.

My presence elicits terror across the globe. Nations tremble in anticipation of my arrival, and heroes flock to my location, their eyes gleaming with determination. However, I am not a man of violence or cruelty. I am a man of grace, a man of intellect, a man of compassion.

I offer the only safe haven in a world steeped in uncertainty. I am the only normal person amidst a sea of superheros, a beacon of hope amidst the darkness. I am the only one who recognizes the inherent goodness within you, the only one who wants to create a world where fear and oppression are distant memories.

In this table, we share a moment of respite. I reveal my heart to you, my vulnerabilities, my fears, and my hopes for the future. I offer you the chance to understand me, to see me not as a villain but as a misunderstood visionary.

So, come join me on this journey, my dear John. Let us build a world where the ordinary triumphs over the extraordinary, and the impossible becomes possible.

In the name of destruction,

,"They teach everyone in school not to cross paths with themselves. It causes some sort of paradox and ends time or something like that. Osiel finishes zipping his suit up, checking to make sure that all his weaponry is attached. The truth is much more terrible. It creates something their unit calls an Aberration or, nicknamed by the older members, a Horror. 
 
 Osiel looks up to the rest of his team heading out. He ’ s down one member, Kristoff ’ s past self exists in the timeline that they ’ re headed to as well as the area. The rest of his group is fine, Naz, Edy, and Rhys finishing their own preparations. It would take time for the Aberration ’ s presence to shift the timeline and assuming everything goes well, it shouldn ’ t do it in the first place. 
 
 Osiel shuts his locker, scowling. People could be such idiots. Even with all the warnings, they don ’ t take heed and avoid their past selves. No, they all attempt to change something that ‘ went wrong ’ back before. Instead, they create a mess. 
 
 “ Let ’ s go! ” He calls to the rest of the team and receiving varying replies in the affirmative range. The transport room is cold, as always. An intern catches up beside him, feet moving twice as quick to keep up with Osiel ’ s long strides. “ Report identity and information. ” 
 
 “ Phillip Schwegel. Age sixty-seven. Transported back fifty-two years. ” Naz whistles, the sound coming from close behind him. 
 
 “ Well now, this is going to be an ugly fucker. ” 
 
 “ Made contact at a mall in the town of Edmonton. ” The intern continues as if Naz hasn ’ t said a word. “ Illogicality clocked at just after fifteen hundred hours past time, about ten minutes ago our time. ” The intern stumbles and Osiel watches his hair color change, the scowl deepening on his face. 
 
 “ Nevermind the rest of the details. We are ready to go. ” Osiel easily jumps up and into the apparatus for transport. The sounds of three other landing indicate the usable portion of his team joining in. Strapping himself in, he hears repeats of the normal pre-transport procedure. Rhys prays to a God that Osiel is sure doesn ’ t exist, Edy dictates a new version of her will, and Naz chuckles at Edy. The only thing missing is Kristoff ’ s calm telling off of Naz and the usual reminder that she should remake her own will periodically. 
 
 “ Prepared for transport. ” One of the doctors calls out. Another counts down from five for them. Osiel keeps his eyes open at zero. The world seems to flash by in an instant. Decades pass in less than the blink of an eye and leave the four of them standing outside of what had formerly been a mall and in their full suits. 
 
 “ Orochi, heading in! ” Naz calls through the comm, voice distorted with a slight echo. The dark blue, almost black, suit of dragon-like armor darts past him, skimming the ground on a pair of wings. 
 
 “ Follow. Vulpes, hold back and give us ranged support. ” Osiel turns his head to look at his teammate. Rhys hums, the head on the green, fox-like armor nodding up and down as he jumps high, landing on one of the remaining spires and drawing one of his weapons, what appears to be a large bow. 
 
 Osiel turns and heads after Naz, hearing Edy hurrying behind him. Naz is far ahead, already heading into what ’ s left of the building. Osiel grimaces and quickens his pace. One day, he ’ s convinced that Naz will fail to return and they ’ ll carry Orochi back to base without her, the armor ready to take the next owner. As he and Edy enter the partially destroyed building, the broken glass distorts his reflection of silver armor and a hawk-head. 
 
 “ Horus, I have confirmation of the Aberration. ” Edy ’ s voice is quiet, with a background of a stronger tone over the comm, despite the fearsome appearance of her golden lion armor. 
 
 “ Confirm location, Nemea. ” 
 
 “ Orochi has initiated battle. Directly ahead, two hundred yards. ” Rhys darts by overhead, headed towards where the sounds of a fight echo. Osiel silently curses Naz once more before darting ahead himself. Damn woman couldn ’ t wait. A flash of light from Rhys ’ s bow highlights the Aberration in its full horrific nature. 
 
 It ’ s huge. Big enough that Naz is only half the size of its foot, with enough teeth to scare any shark silly, and enough pulsing flesh to make the stomach churn. It screams with distorted, pained voices even as it lashes out with one of its many arms at Naz. Phillip Schwegel had made quite the mess of things. 
 
 “ Nemea, put defense on Orochi and myself. ” Osiel draws the claymore at his side, dodging in to attack. A golden aura appears around himself and Naz, the woman hacking away with twin blades at the Aberration. Another flash of light, hitting the monstrosity in the face and it screams again. There are still people attempting to flee the scene, some of the arms grasping at them and squeezing until they pop. 
 
 Osiel removes a few of the arms before it can try it again with another group of people. Edy ’ s golden light appears around another set before her wire slices off more limbs. The empty spots smoke as the creature reels back and sends a hard hit into Osiel, sending him flying across the floor. He recovers, Naz already leaping up the creature, dragging one weapon low and through as she moves. 
 
 “ Orochi! ” She jumps to the side just in time as a multitude of limbs slam into her location, all the ‘ fingers ’ sharp and pointed. Naz removes more of the limbs with a snarling growl heard over all the comms. Osiel rejoins her, dodging and blocking hits as they hack more of the Aberration apart, flashes of light indicating Rhys ’ s attacks. 
 
 “ Horus, check! ” Edy shouts and Osiel blocks a surprise blow from behind. Naz gives another noise of anger, dodging in and cutting more of the creature off. “ Orochi, check! ” Naz dodges to the side, the Aberration stabbing itself and it lunges after her, a large mouth full of teeth bared. She bounces, dodges, and floats out of the way of the jaws closing. Osiel takes advantage of the situation, leaping up to land on the creature. 
 
 “ Orochi, distract! ” He calls to Naz and receives no confirmation. He doesn ’ t expect one with her hands full. He charges the claymore, the blade setting off a slight glow before he cuts right through the head of the creature. It falls to the ground, dissipating instantly. Naz laughs, bounding forward to slice the creature the rest of the way. 
 
 “ Orochi! ” Edy shouts. There ’ s another flash of light, letting Osiel see that another mouth has simply formed on the creature. It lunges forward and there ’ s a crash, Naz hitting the ground further away and with a bite wound through her armor. She ’ s bleeding all over the floor. Osiel dodges a group of limbs attempting to skewer him, cutting half of them off before charging forward. 
 
 “ Nemea! Offense! ” The glow around him weakens and there ’ s a roar from behind him, the flames lashing out and burning the Aberration. The golden glow fades away, Edy ’ s attentions focused on attack now. Osiel removes more pieces of the Aberration as Naz leaps back into the fray despite her injuries. He ’ s almost assured that Orochi is fixing her as she fights. 
 
 Osiel sticks his blade through another section and the creature shudders, starting to dissipate even as it lunges at him, one horrific eye focused on him. Naz slams into him, knocking him away and screams as it latches onto her, handling her like a ragdoll before carelessly tossing her to the side. She drops like a sack of potatoes. 
 
 Edy screams and the flames grow stronger as more flashes hit the creature from Rhys. Osiel regains his feet and runs in with a hard slash. The screaming comes to an abrupt end as the creature dissipates away, leaving the destroyed mall. Osiel turns his attention towards Naz, finding Edy already there. 
 
 “ Nemea? ” There ’ s a long silence before Edy looks towards him. Her eyes are sorrowful. Osiel hears Rhys land close behind him, the man murmuring a prayer in some strange language as he quickly steps forward, leaning down beside Naz ’ s crumpled form. The woman is clutching at the deep wounds in her body, writhing in pain as the wounds become infected, the creature ’ s bite seeming to have been venomous. 
 
 “ Shit. ” Naz ’ s voice gurgles through the blood running from her throat. The Orochi is starting to vanish away, drawing back into the small capsule form as it senses the death of its user. 
 
 “ Naz… ” Osiel ’ s voice is a murmur and Naz ’ s eyes focus hazily on him, blood running from her mouth. 
 
 “ Don ’ t—look at me—like that. ” She smiles with blood-stained teeth. “ You ’ re the—better leader—You need to… ” She fades away mid-sentence, eyes becoming blank before her body completely vanishes away, as if she never existed. Osiel stays quiet, sensors alerting him to the area rebuilding itself with the removal of the Aberration. He picks up Orochi. 
 
 “ We need to go. ” He leads the way back out to the deployment point, keying in a few options to his armor. Edy and Rhys are beside him, both completely silent. He shuts his eyes this time when they transfer back to the future. He didn ’ t want to see it this time. 
 
 “ Returning Nemea, Horus, Vulpes. ” A voice calls out and Osiel opens his eyes. He ’ s looking down at his hand holding Orochi. “ Orochi in shell form. ” They ’ re back in the transfer room and Osiel leaves the apparatus last. 
 
 “ We ’ ll take Orochi from here, Osiel. ” One of the doctors takes the small object from him. “ Orochi will decide upon a new recipient. ” The woman pats him on the shoulder before turning away. Osiel looks after her and Orochi until they vanish through a door before he turns to head towards the lockers. 
 
 Another lost.

The rest of his group is fine, Naz, Edy, and Rhys finishing their own preparations. It would take time for the Aberration ’ s presence to shift the timeline and assuming everything goes well, it shouldn ’ t do it in the first place.

As Osiel shut his locker, he felt a hand brush against his arm. He turned to see Naz, his eyes wide. ""I need to talk to you, Osiel,"" Naz whispered. He took Osiel's hand and pulled him close. ""There's something I need to tell you about the Aberration.""

They walked away from the locker room, hand in hand. Osiel listened intently to Naz's concerns, his heart pounding with anticipation. As he spoke, Naz's voice was soft as a breeze, yet Osiel felt the strength behind it.

""We're not just changing the past,"" Osiel said, his voice low. ""We're creating a mess.""

Naz nodded, his eyes mirroring Osiel's concern. ""I know. I'm sorry I haven't been able to get in touch. I've been so busy trying to figure out what to do.""

Osiel reached out and took Naz's hand. ""It's okay, Naz. We're all trying to do our best.""

They stood there, their hands clasped together, their eyes locked in a moment of understanding. The transport room was cold, as always, but Osiel felt warmth in his heart.

""Let's go!"" he called to the rest of the team, and with a swift nod, the team began to move toward the transport room. The sounds of three landings indicated the usable portion of his team joining in.

As Osiel jumped into the apparatus for transport, Naz leaned in and whispered, ""I love you, Osiel.""

Osiel turned to Naz and smiled. ""I love you too, Naz.""

,"I loved the smell of Pa after a long day in the field, a salty beef odor distinctly his, mixed with the lemon scented soap Ma used to wash our clothes. He always smiled in those days, a satisfied exhausted grin stretched from ear to ear, a contented happiness that I would miss in the years to come. 
 
 
 
 I always used to wait for him to come in from the fields, excited when I heard the thud of his boots on the porch. I would sit beside him as he washed for dinner, watch as he rinsed clean of the moist grey soil whistling tunelessly between his front teeth. Every day when he finished he would tussle my hair and hoist me up into his arms where I would rest my head on his shoulder and breathe in that smell. The scent of those happy easy times. 
 
 
 
 I can still remember when the worry started in Pa ’ s face. I was playing just off the porch, plucking at those pretty white crooked flowers that Ma always loved. Piling them up in the multi-hued grey of the dirt ready to be strung into chains to be hung around my neck. Pa was working on his squeaky old truck, arms and face smudged with black oil as he fiddled under the hood. I had watched with gaping mouth when the Smith ’ s truck had come down the winding dirt lane to our farm. The whole Smith clan peering out from around their piled up possessions, stacked high to the pale sky. Seemed like everything they owned was on that truck, chair and table and dresser and drawer tied together into a jumbled maze of wicker and wood. 
 
 
 
 Pa and Mr Smith had spoken for a while, heads bowed close together in solemn congress, hushed and stern dispute. Pa shook his head several times, disagreeing or refusing with Mr Smith and his quiet calm implorations. After a time they stopped and shook hands with a rough tight grip, fiercely squeezing at each other ’ s work scarred hand. Finally with a clap on Pa ’ s shoulder Mr Smith had climbed back in his truck and then wheeled it around heading away from our farm. Pa stood there for a while, watching them rattle down our rutted road fading off into the distant grey. 
 
 
 
 I woke that night to Ma and Pa in muttered argument, hissed words just loud enough to disturb my sleep. I had lay in my bed, rough blanket pulled to my chin bathed in the silver of the moon peeking through my window. Lay and listened as Ma begged at Pa in a pleading tone. Pa had finally spoke loud in the still quiet of the night, Enough. After that I heard no more, finally drifting off into uneasy sleep. 
 
 
 
 It was weeks before we saw the first roiling cloud. A dark angry looking puff of black streaked with glints of silvery light. It dragged itself over the horizon and loomed there almost snarling at us as it tossed and turned unsteadily in the hot wind. Pa spent the day sealing the windows and packing everything away under tied down tarps. Frenetically moving from task to task, one eye on what he was doing the other fixed firmly on that crouched demon looming above us, stirring fitfully in the wind. Ma kept me on the porch that day and watched lest I wander off. I was scared at the look in her eyes, a fearful wateriness I had never seen before. 
 
 
 
 In the late afternoon the beast pounced. It came rolling down off the hills with a mournful howl. Clawing itself across the ground, squeezing its dirty fingers into every nook and cranny forcing us to retreat into the farm house, hiding from its stinging gritty sleet. Pa tried to make a game of it that night. All of us camped together in the parlor, huddled together under a makeshift tent of bed sheets as the wind howled and scratched at the timber of our cozy home. Ma sang me off to sleep, rocking me to her chest as she sang lullabies in her quiet soothing voice. 
 
 
 
 We woke the next morning to an outlandish sight. The familiar lines of the barn huddled under a mountain built of fine dust, the ground and everything I could see hidden beneath that same dull shroud. Pa had looked so gloomy that day, his mask of ash colored dust tracked with streaks of slow running tears as he looked out at the torn battered remnants of the fields. 
 
 
 
 The days that followed ran together into a shapeless grey scene. Each day Pa struggling to push back at that ever inching barrage of earth, come to swallow the whole damned place. A creeping uncaring succubus draining and sapping him till his skin was a pale pallor, dyed by worry and his unceasing toil. Each night Ma and Pa debated in hushed vicious tones, each night Ma getting louder and Pa fading as he slowly lost his unceasing war. 
 
 
 
 I woke one morn to a different man. Bowed beneath the weight of the world as he tied each treasured possession to a towering pile strapped to the truck with dust covered rope. That bright grin and shining eyes shuttered beneath a lampshade of his disappointment and misery. His shoulders bent over in mute defeat as we turned our backs to the farm and drove away, unable to battle any longer. 
 
 
 
 Two long years we lived in the camps. Days I spent running through the powdery grey dust, chasing and playing with the other filthy urchins set loose by our parent ’ s indifferent attention, focused instead on their own daily struggle. Two years with the taste of dust on everything, coating the back of my throat and dying my skin into a filthy mottled hue. Two years of Pa sat in that same wooden chair only stirring to refill his glass from the ever present bottle at his elbow. Slowly sinking smaller and deeper into his chair as he watched his world crumble around him, his familiar smell now the stink the dust and his sour whisky. Two years of Ma working from dawn till dusk, begging and scrounging for any job that would put a crust on the table and whisky in Pa ’ s glass. 
 
 
 
 It ended as suddenly as it began, the clouds of dust stilled and the sun smiled again from pale sky, warm on our skin after its long absence. It felt like the camp held its collective breath at first, everyone scared that it was just a brief reprieve in this never-ending storm. Finally people began to pack and leave. Tying belongings back on to long-suffering vehicles, rattling off for yearned for homes. Ma had finally stirred Pa, setting him to packing our home back to the top of our rusted old truck, finally pushing him to carry us home. 
 
 
 
 I almost didn ’ t recognise the farm when we returned, covered as it was with a thick rug of that familiar choking grit, mounded high in a pall over my beloved home. I had wandered out into the desolate fields and stood staring out across that same dull grey feeling numb at our farms indifferent greeting. 
 
 
 
 As I stood there a rumble of thunder stirred the air and with a weary fear that I looked at the sky, ready to see those same familiar dusty clouds. Instead the sky was filled with puffs of fluffy white, rolling through the sky with playful glee. Drifting in the sky with their bright happy form, occasionally burping with burbling thunder. The air felt cool on my skin as I stood and gazed up at that tumbling sky watching clouds that didn ’ t loom in ominous warning, clouds not filled with choking grit. Fat drops of rain had begun to fall, pattering and dimpling the coating of my dust choked realm. 
 
 
 
 My eye was caught by a flash of unfamiliar pigment, a flower peeked from beneath the dark carpet on the ground, small fragile petals washed clean by the fresh purifying rain. I had never seen a flower like this, inked in a hue that stood out brightly from familiar dull shades. A bold and unique color, sketched in warm tones that set my heart pounding in my chest. The rain washed more of the dust away, revealing a carpet of bright happy petals peaking from beneath the featureless plane. 
 
 
 
 I knelt on the ground as the rain fell about me and cupped one of the bright cheerful blossoms in my streaked pale hands. It came away easily as I tugged and sat smiling up at me from my curled sheltering palm.

The doctor diagnosed him with differential schizophrenia. Nothing worked: Clozapine, Aripiprazole, Loxipine, he tried them all. Then he met Victoria. The voices simply disappeared; from the moment he bumped into her on the subway platform, and for the first time in his life, Patrick did n't have his imaginary entourage. She was beautiful.

,"In the ancient lands of Euphoma, magic surges like a wildfire. Many wizards and scholars have tried to understand this magnificent power only to fall dead in their tracks or fleeing from it because of the known fact that this magic is dangerously uncontrollable. Those who do harness it only find that it is a curse more than a breakthrough. Reasons being both self and environmental harm. But still fools, though they truly are not fools for they are academics with years on end of schooling, still attempt to master this beautifly dangerous curse regardless of all of the casualties and rumors. 
 
 But there is talk in the lands. A whisper so faint that even a rat's ear can barely find it audible. A secret society known for many names has a group of wizards nearly on the verge of wielding this magic. Their name may not be known to the common ear, but for our sakes, they are The Manamen. 
 
 The wise elder of The Manamen, Kiosky, entered the damp altar where five of his acolytes stood in the center. They took the formation of a star, each acolyte taking his place at each point of the star. The star signified the blazing sun, for which under deep study and countless hours of deciphering, it is understood that the sun is the origin of this magic. 
 
 `` Now my brothers.'' Kiosky said in his ancient raspy voice. `` Noon is upon us. The great inferno is at its peak. Now we must act or forever be in the dark of this power.'' 
 
 The five acolytes began to talk under their breaths in an ancient, forgotten language only few architecs would understand. The star began to failty illuminate the room. Kiosky wandered to the middle of the star and held his hands up into the air. He concentrated, feeling the hurricane of magic surge around him. The cieling of the alter gave way, floating up into the sky toward the blazing sun. The bright light stung down into the altar, blinding the acolytes, yet they continued their chants. Kiosky felt the power of the magic surge around hims, as if it were tearing away his body spiritually. He screamed, but not because of pain, but because he was so close to harnessing this immense power. He felt it surge through his veins. Dance with his soul. Roar in his ear. The sun got hotter and hotter. Brighter and brighter. 
 
 `` I see it brothers!'' Kiosky bellowed. `` I see the truth of this magic! Now I must make it mine!'' 
 
 Kiosky's eyes grew golden and his body glowed a godly aura. He opened his mouth to scream, no sound. Instead a beam of golden light shot out of his mouth. Then his eyes. Then ears. Then scattered throught his body, beam after beam shooting out. Until... 
 
 Kiosky exploded into millions of pieces in a golden fire. His acolytes stunned, all found shelter away from the sun. The room grew darker as the noon sun motioned away, growing closer to the evening. The acolytles stared in terror at the burnt ashes of which used to be their wise elder. 
 
 Will anyone ever understand this intense magic?
","Rewrite the essay with a comedic twist - every time someone uses magic , it 's not dangerous at all- instead it plays fun music and funny sound effects in the background .","In the ancient lands of Euphoma, magic is more like a party than a threat. Oh boy, does it throw some epic parties! Every time someone uses magic, it's not dangerous at all, instead, it plays fun music and funny sound effects, like a giant, sparkly disco ball in the sky.

In this magical land, where the sun is the source of all power, there's a secret society known as The Manamen. These wizards are like the coolest kids on the block, with their flowing robes and pointy hats. But don't be fooled by their appearance. These wizards are not messing around.

The wise elder of The Manamen, Kiosky, is a master of magic and the leader of his acolytes. He's like the king of the party, making sure everyone has a good time. One sunny afternoon, Kiosky and his acolytes gathered in the altar, ready to unleash their powers.

As Kiosky began to concentrate, the star above them started to dance and twirl, creating a dazzling disco effect. The music started playing, and the sound effects were so loud you could hear them from miles away. The acolytes started chanting and dancing, making sure everyone was having a good time.

So, if you're ever in the ancient lands of Euphoma, and you see a wizard casting a spell, don't panic. Just relax and enjoy the party, because magic is not dangerous at all. It's all about having a good time and spreading joy.",LabsGuBnmK

,"Mr. Jones absently stared at the four round patches of ash in his perfect lawn. He had sworn to keep his old friend's lawn beautiful when he became President of the United States, and accepted a life of near constant surveillance to do it. A trifle to some in this age, but a hard sacrifice for a freed-loving man from the mountains. His loyalty to his friend and pride in his work were what kept him going. Now, he hardly noticed the procession of giant insects solemnly walking towards the White House. He had failed in his duty. 
 
 Resistance was futile. Arnold, chief of security, had already lost two men trying to stop the steady advance of the aliens. If you stayed out of their way you were fine, but attempt to stop them and you were toast. Literally. The halls smelled like burning hair in some places. They were clearly here for the President. At first they ( slowly ) made for the Oval Office, but when the President was evacuated they changed direction to follow him. He would have been flown or driven out by now except that all approaching vehicles had been immediately destroyed by the alien landing craft. The invaders themselves and their ship seemed resistant to all forms of attack. 
 
 President Reed was a very nice old man, and very honorable. When faithful Arnold had run to him and desperately tried to say everything but `` I ca n't stop them'', Reed calmly shushed him and said, 
 
 `` It's obviously me they want. If I go they may leave the rest of you alone.'' He began to walk towards the aliens, who had just rounded a corner in the bunker and entered the long escape tunnel. 
 
 `` Sir, will you at least leave your cat here?'' Arnold pleaded. 
 
 `` Mittens has kept me company all three years of my Presidency, and I will certainly want him wherever I go now.'' 
 
 President Reed, you see, had the one eccentricity that he always kept his cat with him, to the dismay of all his stricter staff members. Mittens was in his arms now, a regally purring pile of white fluff. 
 
 At his command all of the President's company stayed behind. Reed approached the aliens at the same pace they approached him. He showed no fear. 
 
 When they stood about a meter away the aliens stopped. The President stopped as well. There were five of them, one in front and four double-file behind. The one in front was carrying a golden box with red hinges in two of its little arms. It reached forward, opened the box – 
 
 And revealed catnip and a beautiful salmon fillet inside.

",Rewrite the essay as a technical post-mortem of the incident .,"**Post-Mortem of the Alien Invasion**

The recent alien invasion at the White House has been a tragedy that has left a lasting impact on the nation. The event unfolded in a manner that showcased the vulnerabilities of our civilization and the tenacity of our leaders in the face of adversity.

The incident began with the arrival of a massive alien landing craft, which unleashed a swarm of giant insects upon the pristine lawns of the President's residence. Despite the valiant efforts of security personnel, the invaders proved to be relentless, overwhelming even the most seasoned warriors. The hallways of the White House were eerily filled with the stench of burning hair as the alien horde relentlessly made their way towards the Oval Office.

The President, a man of dignity and unwavering resolve, refused to be cowed by the threat of annihilation. He knew that his presence was the only thing standing between the aliens and the rest of the nation. With determination etched in his eyes, he calmly walked towards the invaders, a testament to his unwavering commitment to his duty.

The invaders, initially targeting the Oval Office, changed their course upon the President's evacuation. They relentlessly pursued him, their sights set on driving him out of the country. However, fate intervened in the form of the President's unwavering companion, Mittens, a beloved feline with a purr that could shake the very foundations of the Earth. In a moment of compassion, the President refused to leave his beloved companion behind, even in the face of certain danger.

The battle between the President and the aliens was fierce, but ultimately futile. The invaders proved to be impervious to all forms of attack, and their ship unleashed a devastating force that destroyed all approaching vehicles. Despite the tragedy that unfolded, the President's courage and resilience serve as a reminder to all of the strength that can be found in even the darkest of times.",ELAxwfkWqm

The narrative presents a surreal encounter that epitomizes the fragility of human existence against the backdrop of a fleeting moment of illumination and the contemplation of mortality. The image of the fog obscuring vision echoes the ephemerality of the human condition, while the gold sword symbolizes the potential for destruction and the fleeting nature of worldly possessions. The protagonist's forward movement and subsequent stumble symbolize the perpetual dance between ambition and vulnerability, culminating in a tragic impaling upon the blade and the realization of the irreversibility of death. The final words ""Deathless"" evoke a paradoxical sentiment, highlighting the enduring power of intellectual curiosity and the profound realization of the ephemeral nature of life, regardless of the circumstances of demise.",
,"`` Your curls... they're so... dreamy...'' 
 
 That was the last thing my girlfriend said to me before we were T-boned by an SUV. It sent our car careening off the bridge into the icy Hudson River. That was all I could remember before I woke up, 3 months later, on a hospital bed. 
 
 I was told by the nurses that my car was unsalvageable, the driver of the SUV was in jail, and that my girlfriend was dead. The last part hit me the hardest, as it was just a few months ago we had both agreed to get married after I finished Law school. And now its was all gone. 
 
 I could hardly recognize myself. I was all skins and bones from being in a coma for such a long time. The only thing that remained the same... was my hair. The curls that my girlfriend loved. 
 
 I did n't know when it happened, or how it happened, but whenever I dream, I can control things, I can enter peoples' dreams and see their whole life before my eyes. It was scary. I could n't stand it at first. But slowly I started to the see the good in my strange ability. I did n't know if I was a `` superhero'', but I was doing something right. I was making people happy. But what do I call myself?

,"`` Pilot, identify yourself.'' 
 
 The new Air Traffic Control Operator, Jin, in Beijing began to scramble as an unknown aircraft headed for the runway. The plane was going to disrupt the flow of air traffic, as it had not been on schedule. 
 
 `` This is Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370. Prepared for landing.'' 
 
 Jin stopped dead in his tracks. He pushed the millions of possibilities out of his head for just a moment because maybe, just maybe, he had heard the number of the flight wrong. 
 
 `` Could you repeat the number of the aircraft, Captain?'' Jin asked. 
 
 `` Yes, uh, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370. That's 3-7-0. Prepared for landing.'' 
 
 The thoughts burst through the door of the Jin's head. The situation was clearly impossible. Malaysia Flight 370 had been lost three months ago. Maybe the Captain just was confused as to what number aircraft he was actually flying. 
 
 `` C-Clear for landing, C-Captain.'' 
 
 Jin's voice shook more than he anticipated. He quickly spun around and pointed directly between the eyes of one of his co-workers. 
 
 `` Lee, what was the exact day that Malaysian Flight got lost at sea?'' 
 
 Lee looked at him skeptically. `` March something. I do n't know for sure.'' 
 
 The Controller turned quickly around and rapidly typed his burning question into Google. He found the date: March 8, 2014. No. It could n't be. He looked into the bottom right hand corner of his computer screen and read the day's date aloud:'June 8, 2014'. 
 
 `` Three months.'' 
 
 `` What?'' Lee walked up behind Jin and, while taking a sip of coffee, put his hand on Jin's shoulders to comfort his lingering unease. Jin looked up and watched the Flight land, then slowly pointed at the aircraft. 
 
 `` T-that flight sitting out on the runway is Malaysia Flight 370 - 3 months late.'' 
 
 The coffee mug slipped from Lee's hand and shattered upon impact with the tiled floor. 
 
 Flight 370 pulled into the gate. The sounds of sirens inside and outside made the passengers uneasy as they began to exit the airplane. As they exited the grey bridge, cameras and reporters surrounded each and every one of them. The police pulled some of them aside as well. Questions were flown everywhere.'Where have you been?''What happened to the flight?''Is anyone injured?''Did you land anywhere else?''Was it alien abduction?' 
 
 The passengers were confused. Their explanations were all the same. They boarded the flight at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia, then made the six hour flight to Beijing. One man in first class did explain they hit some minor turbulence midway through the flight, and that the six hours seemed eerily *long*, but nothing to raise any eyebrows. 
 
 Lee and Jin sprinted their way through the crowds of people anxiously headed to the same destination. Thoughts and possibilities on what could have happened to the plane were swarming their heads. But upon arrival, they received the same feedback from the passengers as everyone had: nothing had gone wrong. 
 
 Out of questions to ask, Lee and Jin backed out of the crowd and began their long walk back to the control tower. 
 
 `` There's no way just *nothing* could have happened to those people. They're obviously hiding something.'' Lee said. 
 
 `` Maybe, my friend.'' Jin answered, but Lee was n't finished. 
 
 `` It could have been aliens, could have been North Korea, could have been Russia, could have been a glitch in the matrix, could have been-'' 
 
 `` It could have been anything, Lee. Aliens, governments, different dimensions, glitches in the matrix, fate, destiny, God-like powers, anything! But I do n't believe in any of those things. Those are solutions to the problem.'' 
 
 `` So what is it then?'' asked the desperate Lee. 
 
 Jin sighed, and continued. `` All I believe is that I saw Malaysia Flight 370 land on the runway today, in one piece, and I also saw your coffee mug split into hundreds of pieces today - something had to give.''
",Rewrite this with a documentary style and remove all supernatural or extraterrestrial elements,"In the heart of Beijing, the air traffic control tower buzzed with activity. Jin, a new operator, found himself in the midst of an unprecedented situation. As an unknown aircraft barreled toward the runway, it threatened to disrupt the delicate balance of air traffic.

The plane, bound for a landing, carried the weight of an unexpected delay. As Jin's mind raced through a million possibilities, he paused, his breath suspended in mid-air. Could it be that he had heard the number of the flight incorrectly? He asked the Captain to repeat the number, hoping for a glimmer of confirmation.

The Captain's voice echoed through the air, ""Yes, uh, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370. That's 3-7-0. Prepared for landing.""

In that moment, Jin's world stood still. The situation was impossible. Flight 370 had been lost three months ago. Could the Captain be mistaken? He frantically searched for answers, his voice shaking more than he had ever imagined.

As he frantically pointed between his eyes and his coworker, Lee, Jin asked, ""Lee, what was the exact day that Malaysian Flight got lost at sea?""

Lee stared at him, his skepticism palpable. ""March something. I do n't know for sure.""

With determination etched on his face, Jin began to search for the answer. He found the date: March 8, 2014. No, it couldn't be. He looked down at the date on his screen and read it aloud, ""June 8, 2014.""

The realization dawned upon him. Three months. The flight sat on the runway, a testament to the inexplicable and the uncanny. He pointed at the aircraft, his voice trembling.

,"Sam thoroughly washed his body parts a couple of extra times as he was finishing up in the shower. 
 
 The sudden realization that his life was now his to manage has over empowered him. Sam knew that he could turn his and his children's life around. He had a lot of help from friends and family. 
 
 He opens the shower door and reaches for the towel but his hand returns empty handed. Odd, he knew that he grabbed one and put it on the towel rack. 
 
 He stood in the shower letting the moisture fall off of him. He carefully stepped out of the shower and started to walk in the direction of the towels, only to be shocked by his wife, Becky. 
 
 Becky's legs were propped up against the sink as she was leaning. Her skinny jeans fit well around her slender body. Hair was full of water, bringing out the darkness of her sandy blond hair. Blood shattered the beauty in her green eyes. Her posture showed an odd mixture of anxiety and pleasure. Sam knew that she was on drugs. 
 
 `` What are you doing here, how did you get in?'' Sam inquired. The last time his eyes shed a glance on her was over 3 months ago. She was being taken away by the cops after coming after him with a knife. No one was hurt, and he was lucky that his kids had the courage to stand up for their father, confirming his accusations. 
 
 He had a restraining order put against her shortly afterwards. He tried to serve her with divorce papers, but he had no listed address to server her with. 
 
 `` Timothy let me in, he said that he misses mommy and loves her more than daddy. I persuaded him that I would save him from your abusive habits if he let me in. So here I am.'' Becky scowled. 
 
 It was all a lie. She always fabricated stories to make herself look good. It was his greatest pet peeve of her's. Months ago he thought he had the courage to stand up to her. His emotions said otherwise as he was headed further into depression. The only thing that made him look forward to the next day is knowing that his kids needed him. He tried to reconcile with his wife, and tried getting her mental help; but she was nowhere to be found after being released from her initial hearing. Sam had no idea where she was. Until now. 
 
 `` I doubt he said that. What are you doing here!? You need to leave now, there is a RO out against you and I will call the cops.'' Sam threatened. this was his awakening. His sudden realization that he needed to provide the children with a healthier parent. And he needed to be that parent. 
 
 Becky released his towel hostage and threw it at him. `` Whatever, you never could stand up for me anyways. After you dared call the cops on me, I realized that you never loved me! No one calls the cops on their spouse if they love them as much as I did to you! But you betrayed me, like a coward!'' She left the bathroom and headed towards the children's room where their children, Timothy and Susan were playing. Sam quickly put on his towel and followed. Timothy was six and Susan just turned nine. Neither of them could quite understand the situation. The downside was that they did n't know how to say no to mommy. Sam did n't think they would need to be tested, but this shower has proven otherwise. 
 
 `` Oh yeah, I'm taking the kids, permanently.'' Becky announced. 
 
 `` No you wo n't! You ca n't! They are covered under the Restraining Order as well!'' 
 
 A stranger's voice came from the children's room. `` Yes she can, as long as I have something to do with it.'' A man came into view. He was rather scrawny, deep voice, heavily tattooed and had those ridiculous ear gauges. His eyes were also staring down the sights of a Glock 17, barrel aimed at Sam's head. 
 
 Blood and anger rushed everywhere. Sam could n't believe it. This was it, there was nothing he could do. He was n't going to see his kids again, and worse, he was helpless to help them. The consequences of him taking a shower with his kid's unsupervised stormed through his mind. How could he be so negligent? He could have called a neighbor to watch his kids. 
 
 `` Get on the floor!'' The stranger ordered with Timothy and Susan looking onwards. 
 
 `` No! Please, do n't do this!'' Sam pleaded. 
 
 The stranger put a pair of zip-ties around his wrists and his an ankles. He also put a strip of duct tape across Sam's mouth. `` Shut up, you have no right to talk. I've been fucking your wife for six months now. I ca n't believe you were stupid enough to think you were worth anything to her. Time to pay the price.'' 
 
 The stranger shoved Sam into the kid's closet and shut the door. He heard footsteps head downstairs. He was sure that he was alone on the top floor. 
 
 But Sam was no fool. Him and his coworkers had an odd initiation ritual for the new guys that came in. That was to tie them up in zip-ties and tell them to get out of it. It was rather easy, only took moving your wrists in the right direction. After all of these years, he had never told his wife about this, and now he was glad that he had poor communication with her. 
 
 He easily got out of the wrist ties. The ankle ties took some time. Once he got them loose, he was able to pry out of them with his ankles. With everything off, including the duct tape, his feet quietly rushed towards his room. His phone was gone, but luckily his tracphone was still in his t-shirt drawer. He quickly turned it on and called 911. 
 
 It was at that moment that he started to smell gas. They were going to light him on fire. 
 
 He quickly explained the situation to the police and did his best to keep them up with what was going on. He ran to the ground level of the house to try and find his sawed off shotgun. 
 
 It was gone. 
 
 He quickly looked out the front window to see if his wife's new boyfriend's car was outside. It was. 
 
 Suddenly, smoke started to show up outside. He had no idea what to do. He talked to the cops and they encouraged him to get to safety. 
 
 He used the rarely used side door to escape. Neither his wife or her boyfriend saw him. He quickly ran over to John's house, a neighbor that he knew had a gun. With all of the fences and trees, it was easy to be discrete, even in a towel. 
 
 John was waiting in his garage for him. `` Sam, get over here, the streets are shut down.'' 
 
 `` What?'' Sam asked. 
 
 `` I saw your wife out there about 20 minutes ago. She was banging on the door and threatened the kids to open the door for her. I did n't want to intervene, so I called the cops. I do n't think your wife and her guy know it yet, but the streets are already blocked in every direction. They're responding like there are hostages.'' 
 
 `` Oh my gosh, thanks man! You're a life saver. I need to get my kids though!'' Sam responded. 
 
 `` I'd say that the safest thing at this point is to sit tight. Let the cops do their job. Besides, they can make better shots than either of us could.'' John encouraged. He then continued to talk on his phone with the police. 
 
 Sam and John were in tense conversations with each other over what their respective 911 responders were saying. It seemed like an hour, but it was only half a minute since Sam escaped his house. It was starting to rage in a blaze and that was when the car started moving with his wife and kids in it. He was getting too eager to not intervene. 
 
 `` Hold yourself, Sam!'' John acknowledged. `` They've got it under control.'' 
 
 John and Sam told the operator about the movement. After about 2 minutes, what seemed like 2 hours, the operator told them that the kids were safe and to expect an officer at their door soon. 
 
 Sam was relieved. All of these years he spent complaining about how much he hated cops. But over the past couple of months, he was more than thankful for their service.

The sudden realization that his life was now his to manage has over empowered him. He knew that he could turn his and his children's life around. He had a lot of help from friends and family.

He opens the shower door and reaches for the towel but his hand returns empty handed. Odd, he knew that he grabbed one and put it on the towel rack. He stood in the shower letting the moisture fall off of him. He carefully stepped out of the shower and started to walk in the direction of the towels, only to be shocked by his wife, Becky.

Becky's legs were propped up against the sink as she was leaning. Her skinny jeans fit well around her slender body. Hair was full of water, bringing out the darkness of her sandy blond hair. Blood shattered the beauty in her green eyes. Her posture showed an odd mixture of anxiety and pleasure. Sam knew that she was on drugs.

He had a restraining order put against her shortly afterwards. He tried to serve her with divorce papers, but he had no listed address to server her with. Months later he thought he had the courage to stand up to her, but his emotions said otherwise as he was headed further into depression.

 They were honest words- words that left my mouth desperately following the question and the eternity of silence. 
 
 No- I wasn ’ t stupid. They were words that I knew wouldn ’ t be accepted. 
 The courtroom was a pixilated rainbow. Sprites of various neon hues, meant to stand out against different, darker backgrounds, were jammed next to each other at random in the stadium. Looking at them all made my eyes hurt, so I looked down. Their eyes on me made my heart hurt, so I trembled. 
 
 Boos echoed from the stand at this sign of guilt. The judge- Angra Mainyu, the dragon-king who preceded over the military, the senate, and the courts, allowed it to continue. He knew they weren ’ t in a hurry. He allowed me to suffer. 
 Then, if only to save his own, monster-sized ears and those of the jurors, the strike of his gable finally put an end to it. For now, at least.

A courtroom erupted in a storm of anger and sorrow this afternoon as a defendant uttered the words that left the jury and the judge stunned: ""I don't know.""

The defendant's outburst came during a heated trial, where he was facing a charge of guilt. The courtroom was packed with spectators, each one hoping to catch a glimpse of the drama unfolding before them.

""I'm not stupid, your honor,"" the defendant said, his voice cracking with emotion. ""I just... I don't know the answer to this question.""

The judge, Angra Mainyu, allowed the defendant to continue his speech. Boos echoed from the stands as the defendant spoke about the injustice he felt, blaming the prosecutor and the court system.

Finally, after a lengthy sermon, the defendant's lawyer intervened and asked the judge to put a halt to the proceedings. The judge agreed, and the courtroom erupted into a sigh of relief.

""",
,"Oh man. Today's the day. 
 
 I've been training for years for this day. When my parents first realized I had these powers, they did n't know what to do with me. So they hushed it up. Told me not to use my powers in public, taught me to control my temper and always think things through. They taught me the value of earnest, hard work and doing things the `` old-fashioned'' way, not just rushing through with my powers. And it took a lot of work. It seemed like every other day I had some new power or talent. It started with heightened senses, even when I was a baby. I never cried too loudly, and I quieted down as soon as one of my parents said, `` I'll go,'' even from the other side of the house. My intellect was superlative, as well, at that age. I'm nowhere near Human Computer, Man-droid, or even the Cartographer, but I mastered speech pretty early and I skipped forward a few years in school. 
 
 Which was a good thing, since, at age 11, I was ready to begin training. My poor parents had suffered through strength, speed, pyrokinesis, hydrokinesis, mind reading, full-spectrum vision ( that's X-Ray, for the non-comic book readers ), flight, matter and energy manipulation, time dilation, shapeshifting, waterbreathing, and even a dash of magic -- among many, many others. You name it, I could do it -- almost as well as whatever heroes called those abilities their own. At age 11. So when representatives of the Enclave showed up to train me, my parents were understandably conflicted. Only child, going away for a long time, potentially very dangerous training, yes, but also... no more waking up wondering what, exactly, happened to the house and where, or even if, you would find your daughter. 
 
 For the next seven years, I underwent rigorous, grueling training. I made friends -- Kate, Brian, Sloan, and Carter chief among them. That made the training bearable. Even with superpowers, or maybe especially with superpowers, operating for 96 hours on 1600 calories and 2-3 hours of sleep per day is exhausting. And that was our work week, not counting all the homework on the weekends. My advanced intelligence was really handy at mastering the basic theories and practical applications of physics and chemistry, although I fell short of qualifying for Advanced Ballistics and Spaceflight: Bullet Deflection, ICBM Interception, and Extra-Atmospheric Platforms. But I really excelled at the hands-on training. Single Hostage Extraction, Neutralizing Explosive Devices ( both Pre- and Post-Detonation ), Ambush Survival, Advanced Ambush Survival: Surrounded and Outgunned, and all the rest. 
 
 And it's all led to today. Last week we `` graduated.'' No coursework for a week, freedom to roam the Enclave's grounds, relax, practice, or whatever we wanted. Yesterday was the Naming Ceremony. My friends and I got some pretty sweet names. Kate is going by Northwind, on account of her cold/wind manipulation. Carter is now Megaton, even though his real expertise is in precise, controlled explosions no bigger than a couple of nanometers across. I mean, he can still do the big stuff, but there are, like, seven other heroes who can all do that, too. Brian is The Wizard; ironic since his power is technomancy -- the ability to summon or manipulate technology. And Sloan is Bloodbeam. Mostly her beams are normal energy from a battery pack she designed herself, but if she needs to... just do n't get in her way. As for me, well, I can pretty much do all of those things myself, better even than my friends ( not that I let on ). But I decided to call myself Blackguard. The color has a negative stigma I'm trying to appropriate. Besides, cool black costume, awesome shield ( which I do n't need... I'm bulletproof, and resistant to everything that's ever been thrown at me )... what more could a girl want? 
 
 But today is probably the most important day of our careers so far. Formally, it's `` Mentorship and Learning Partner Assignment,'' but we all just call it sidekick day. The day when we discover whose sidekicks we're going to become. It's the final phase of training. You work with your mentor until he or she decides you're ready to become a full-fledged hero. Considering my immense power, I expect to be paired with a member of the Order of Right. They rarely take sidekicks -- the situations are too dangerous, the sidekicks would slow them down, and, to quote... someone, `` I work *alone*.'' Maybe Titan, Excelsior, Halcyon, or Hyperman. But all of the real top-notch heroes, the members of the Order, are multi-power heroes, like me. They would be the only people who could teach me how to manage my powers in concert during conflicts. 
 
 As we filed in, I spotted Kate and Carter. Because of the no-powers rule on campus, I could only use the slightest time slowing and speed to get to them. We picked up Brian and Sloan as we made our way to our seats. As the five most powerful heroes in the class, we would receive our assignments last, and were seated in the back of the room. 
 
 Dean Scott stepped up to the podium and began speaking. Standard graduation-speech type of stuff. Very proud of you, you can do anything you set your mind to, great potential, blah blah blah. I shifted my focus to the conversations around the room. Whispers, muttering -- everyone just wanted to know who they would be working with. Most people figured they would get a hero with similar powers to them. If that was the case, I was set. Of course, that is a very limited view. Most of these kids would be better served by learning some humility, or else how to work with someone with a drastically different power portfolio. 
 
 A hush fell over the auditorium. Dean Scott looked down, thanked the crowd, and returned to his seat. His assistant, Mr. Bharadwaj, stepped up and adjusted the mic. `` I will now call your names, followed by your mentor assignment. Please remain in your seats and hold all applause until the end. Upon the completion of the ceremony, report to the transports to be brought to your new assignments. As a reminder, those travelling to further sites will travel via teleporter. Now, let us begin. Aaron Eskin. Power: escalated mental acuity. Mentor: Cartographer. Artificial Intelligence 18301. Power: Inherent rapid prototyping, artificial body, and reactive programming. Mentor: Man-droid.'' 
 
 It went on like this for several more kids until I felt the rumbling. I looked around cautiously. There were two, maybe three people in the room who could be causing it. And fewer still who could sense it at this level. Steven Watts was looking around, too, as was Dean Scott. Nobody showed any sign of causing the rumbling -- it was stronger now -- it was n't magic, nobody was showing the increased heat output typical of power-users, and I could n't sense anyone focusing on their powers. Well, besides Steven, whose powers included super hearing. It was coming from the east wall, to my left. *Guys, wake up. Incoming from the left, * I projected to my friends. *Sounds like they're going to breach the wall. Cart -- Megaton, can you do something about that? * He gave a quick nod. Everyone was looking around now; Mr. Bharadwaj had stopped talking. It was noticeable now. People were shifting away from the wall. *Carter NOW* I screamed in my head. The east wall ripped apart in a wide explosion, vaporizing it. The smoke cleared almost instantly, revealing... 
 
 My heart stopped. It was... everyone. All of the greatest villains still at large. Korra, Viper, Analogue, Crypto, Brute, Baron Sturm, Belle Sainte, the Tiger, Hardin the Great, Silver Swordsman, Devilkin, The Monster... any one would be more than a match for most heroes. But there were dozens of us here, all ready for action. So what was their game? Then I felt her. The Mistress, barely visible behind Devilkin and the Swordsman. I could feel her... miasma sitting over the whole room, immobilizing everyone. Starling, Black Hood, and Adam... whatever his title is... our three mentalists were all struggling against Mistress, but none were making any progress. 
 
 Clenching my eyes shut, I probed Mistress's mental net. Nothing. My body was n't responding. No energy beams, no vibrating my particles, no strength, force fields, stretching, or... no. Stop. I have my mind. I can think. My telekinesis is n't working, but my senses and mind reading still work, at least within the room. I ca n't reach the villains' minds. Ok, shit. What do I do? Shit shit shit. Shit. Ambushed, outgunned. Not surrounded, but suppressed. Are my classmates hostages? As long as Mistress stays in control, yes. They're helpless. I think I can get out. There was... something. A hole, or a weakness in her net. I shut my eyes again, block out Hardin's voice. Where was it... THERE. I feel Mistress's concentration. It's so faint, but it's something from outside the net. I grab on to it, push my mind along that thought. It's not much, but I can feel her hold on me. Apparently, she's controlling each of us individually. I slip out of the lasso she has around me, without her notice ( hopefully ). She's strained, though. Ah, freedom feels so good after being constrained like that. Still not moving. They'll notice if I move. But I can scan their brains now. Wow, really? Nothing more complicated than planning to catch us all in one place; eliminate a whole generation of heroes all at once. That feels pretty anticlimactic. 
 
 Ok, focus. There's no way I can take them on alone. I ca n't wrest everyone out of Mistress's control, though. I ca n't just take her out, either. Best case, everyone else in the room passes out, and it's me against a dozen villains. Worst case... my eyes rest briefly on Sloane. If anyone else gets out, Mistress will know. And everyone else is still a hostage. Shit. Shitfuck.

,"“ Greetings, sir, and well met! Today is a momentous occasion, ” the adventurer gave a knowing wink and a snap, “ but as I can tell from your smile you already know who I am. ” 
 
 Rand frowned deeper. He knew no such thing. Though he could guess, and probably that was good enough. 
 
 The adventurer, dirt-smeared and battle-drunk thing that he was, as were all the damned would-be hero adventurers that frequented Rand ’ s shop, sucked in another breath. 
 
 “ I bring you good fortune from the far corners of the world, nay, items of immeasurable value, nay, even greater, noble merchant I bring you— ” 
 
 “ Grocer. ” 
 
 “ Huh? ” The adventurer paused, eyes regaining their focus as his speech fumbled to a stop. 
 
 “ You said merchant. I ’ m just a grocer. ” 
 
 “ Oh, ah. I see. Well. ” The adventurer seemed to think on that a moment, mouth slipping into a slight frown. “ Not as stirring a title, I suppose but… ” he waved away the rest of the words before starting again. Rand struggled to hold in a sigh, then decided it wasn ’ t worth the effort. His shoulders slumped as the sigh escaped him, but the adventurer began again nonetheless. 
 
 “ Behold, noble grocer, I bring you treasures from beyond your wildest dreams! ” He swung open his bag with a flourish. A spattering of items clattered across the counter. Didn ’ t make much noise as they did, but Rand had heard a good number of items clatter across that counter in his day, and in these he heard only more of the same. Disappointment. For him, and for the items ’ would-be seller. 
 
 If sighing were a sport, Rand would ’ ve been its champion. Would ’ ve been a name the bards would sing about, a sportsman the likes of which the world had never seen. But sighing wasn ’ t a sport. And Rand wasn ’ t a champion. He was a grocer. Another thing to sigh at, that. 
 
 “ Ah, I see your eyes can ’ t help but wander to this little mystery, ” the adventurer said, voice lowered like he was sharing a secret. His fingers gestured at the object, shaking and dancing above it in a way Rand didn ’ t doubt was meant to be tantalizing. 
 
 “ You ’ ve good taste, noble…grocer, ” the adventurer paused only slightly at the word before continuing. “ This, you see, is a most rare and valuable item. ” He snatched it into the air, held it high above them, eyes wide as if all the secrets of existence were contained within its curved ivory surface. 
 
 “ This, believe me or not, is the famed— ” 
 
 “ Basilisk ’ s tooth. ” Rand had seen the paltry thing a hundred hundred times before. He could ’ ve listed its qualities both medicinal and arcane. He could ’ ve said where it was found, how it was obtained, the proper ways to store and transport it. Could ’ ve, and didn ’ t. Wasn ’ t worth the time. 
 
 “ Buying price three silver, ” he said, considering throwing in a sigh for good measure. 
 
 The adventurer raised one eyebrow, a light sparking in his eyes. 
 
 “ Three silver you say? ” His voice was full of hope. Funny thing, hope. Easily broken. 
 
 “ Three silver per dozen. ” 
 
 The adventurer balked. 
 
 “ Why, good sir, that ’ s preposterous! Surely there must be some mistake. This is a tooth of the mighty basilisk! The slayer of men, the widower of wives, the orphaner of children! ” 
 
 Rand nodded along, had heard it all before. 
 
 “ Right. That it is. And I ’ ve got about forty of them in the back. ” 
 
 The adventurer tucked the tooth back into his bag. 
 
 “ Well then. A stiff upper lip, my father always said. We must remain firm in the face of adversity, after all. How about this next item? ” He was smiling again, was clearly new to this whole business. 
 
 Rand tuned out the adventurer ’ s overly dramatic presentation to calculate how much he ’ d be paying the man when it was all through. They ’ d haggle first, of course. Or, more like Rand would tell the fool the price of the items, at which point he ’ d bluster and complain and ramble on for a bit. But the end result would be the same. Always had been, always was. The man was just an adventurer, after all. And Rand, just a grocer. Wasn ’ t anything else to it. Just another thing to sigh at, really.

The adventurer, with his swagger and exaggerated tales, had been a whirlwind of charm. But as the layers peeled back, the truth began to unravel, revealing a web of deceit and manipulation.

The adventurer’s words were like honeyed poison, dripping with false promises and broken trust. He had spun a yarn of treasures and fortune, but the only thing he had delivered was disappointment. The items he presented were far from the treasures he had described, and the price he demanded was astronomical.

It was as if the adventurer had deliberately set out to scam Rand, his greed overriding any sense of morality. He had painted a picture of grandeur and prosperity, but the reality was far from the dream. The deal had gone sour, leaving behind a trail of broken promises and shattered hopes.

The adventurer, with his smarmy smile and cunning words, had broken Rand’s trust and confidence. The grocer had been taken for a ride, his money stolen and his time wasted. It was a deal gone bad, a testament to the treacherous nature of human greed and deceit.",OVqgEsStAt

 She never knew what she was. She never understood why she was. She'd never know that her existence was wrath and hate manifested into organic life. It would have been incomprehensible to any, even her. She was the last remnant of human emotion left behind by our kind. The only thing that survived us. But now, after all this time, there was nothing left to forgive. So she forgot, and faded out of existence.

,"It wasn ’ t until after the first 2 children had already been born that I discovered something was amiss with them. They were 3 and 5 years old. Martha and Kelly, respectively, such beautiful young children. Kelly had eyes just like her father ’ s. Soft blue that faded to grey just before the pupils. She shared his personality as well. The way she spoke was so sweet and her innocence was more than I could I hope to have created. However, I could not help but notice she seemed, less than complete. 
 
 It started to show when she was first able to walk and say her first words, I thought it might have been a mental disability, but it proved to be quite different than that. While pregnant with her I felt more rested and relaxed than I ever had. My energy levels spiked, I needed less sleep, and I felt youthful. It was a phenomenon, an unprecedented one. 
 
 No one had ever described pregnancy like this before. Nobody in my life had seemed to have experienced such an increase in health. I had seen other women pregnant before. I had seen them without the desire, or will, to go about their daily activities. Pregnancy had taken a toll on their bodies. It was punishing and painful. For me, though, it was livening. It was pleasant and seemed to heal me. Pregnancy was the best drug I could find. 
 
 I thought it might have been just a fluke. That first pregnancy had to be a mental lapse on my part. The euphoria of having my first child kept me thinking that the experience was enthralling. The second pregnancy proved that notion wrong. This time I focused on the feeling more. I focused and was able to draw more life out of it. The high I got from my pregnancy was not only thrilling, it was so invigorating I was able to accomplish much more than I had in my 32 years before than. 
 
 Then Martha was born. She was premature by about 2 months. She was so small and feeble. The doctors were barely able to keep her alive. Her first 3 years of life were in and out of hospitals. I barely saw her. I don ’ t really know who she was. I felt an odd connection to her, though. Similar to the one I felt with Kelly, but more powerful. It wasn ’ t really a parental connection. It was separate from that. Martha was connected to me in a way I can ’ t quite describe. 
 
 My body had never felt better. I could swear that I did not age one day since Martha came. I didn ’ t look a day over 23. When Martha passed, she looked older than I ever had. She was only 3 years old. No one could figure out what was wrong with her. I ’ m pretty sure I know what happened to Martha. The night she passed I slipped into a heavy and deep sleep and a dream took me away. 
 
 I saw Martha, though she was healthy and alive. She was going about life and accomplishing so much. I watcher her grow up to become a beautiful young woman. I watched her change the world with her small print. She had children, my grandchildren, and they did so much for us as a family. Martha had this opportunity to live a full and fantastic life. I could see how many people she touched and how many loved her. 
 
 I awoke in a pool of tears. My pillow was drenched, my eyes were red, and I could not shake this undeniable feeling of guilt. My heart was weighed down, somehow I knew Martha couldn ’ t live because of me. Martha ’ s life had been taken from her and those years she would have lived, were given to me. I could not explain how I knew. I could just feel the life in me. I could feel the time I had stolen from my own daughter. 
 
 Kelly, my sweet loving Kelly, passed away when she was 10. Again I had a dream. Very much the same as when I dreamed of Martha. A heart wrenching tale of what Kelly ’ s life would ’ ve been. It had almost become too much. My soul was pained by the two lives that I had somehow taken. But how? How did I do that? How did I sap the life from their innocent lives? 
 
 When I was 42 years old, I looked not a day over 25. I felt the same. I had a hunger. My body yearned for more life. I could tell the years I had taken were starting to dwindle. I could tell my body was starting to age again. I could feel the cells in my organs dying and being regenerated. I could see a ticker in my mind, a countdown to my death. It ate at my mind. It sucked at my every thought. 
 
 I couldn ’ t focus. I couldn ’ t work. My body was filled with this pain of knowing my life was temporary. My life was running out. I was going to die. Be it in 5 years, 10 years, or even 50. It didn ’ t matter. I was so painfully aware of the fact that death would come. My body felt so heavy and I could feel it dying. I could feel it ever so slightly ticking away. My life-force drained, albeit slowly, but enough that I could not stand the pain. 
 
 My third pregnancy was over in 4 months. I miscarried. Again I had a dream. A nameless man was growing. I watched him go through life. I watched my son grow up to be a man. I knew how much I loved him. When I awoke I felt nothing. All I knew is that my timer had been lengthened. I knew my life was going to continue longer. I never could tell by how much, but I knew it was there. 
 
 Again invigorated by the life of my child I was able to do so much. My understanding of anything increased substantially. I could do anything I desired. I knew that I had the aptitude to do what I would feel I needed to make my life complete. I had been given a gift. The gift of immortality, at the price of the lives of those I was supposed to sacrifice for. Instead, they now sacrifice for me. 
 
 Only the feeling seems to be draining faster than it did with Kelly or Martha. I need more. I need to live. I need their lives. I can ’ t endure the pain of slowly dying. I can ’ t go through that again. I can feel it edging toward me. The methodical call for death. There is life out there for me to steal. I only need to find someone I can take it from.

,"``... it was just a piece of gum,'' I thought to myself. The fiery glow above the treeline grew more intense by the second as I continued to try and make sense of everything that had transpired earlier today. 
 
 The day started like any other. I woke up, took a shower, and got dressed before heading off to work. The store is close to where I live so unless it was raining, I would normally just walk. Yesterday, as a surprise, my girlfriend Tracy bought me a pack of watermelon flavored bubble gum, my favorite. So, on my walk to work, I threw a piece in my mouth put my headphones in, and started the roughly two mile walk. 
 
 About half way there I have to cross the street and, on any other day, there is zero traffic. I guess this is where it all started cause as I started to cross the road, I was almost hit by a car. Yes, I know, I should have looked both ways and having my headphones in while crossing was probably dumb as well but I was in the process of blowing the biggest bubble I had ever managed. 
 
 So as I'm concentrating intently as this massive bubble, I faintly start to hear the sound of a car horn. Reactively, I gasp and suck the gum into my throat and stumble backwards. This stumble was just enough for me to get out of the way of the car which swerved toward the sidewalk, hitting a power pole. At this point, I'm choking, grasping for any air that I can possibly get. Just as the scene around me start to go black, I see the driver getting out of his vehicle. 
 
 The next thing I remember is waking up in a hospital bed and my parents standing next to me. My head is pounding and my throat hurts like hell. In my lethargic state, I try to get my dad's attention but before I do, sound of the television suddenly becomes clear. It was like someone had suddenly flipped a stereo from mute to full blast. 
 
 `` This is an emergency broadcast from the Department of Homeland Security. Please be advised. The all current major metropolitan cities in the United States have been targeted by the recently detected nuclear launches from Russia and China. This is not a drill. This is not a test. Multiple nuclear launches have been detected heading toward the major metropolitan areas of the United States. In the event that you are....'' The television cut to static. 
 
 I'm not exactly sure why but I got out of bed as quickly as I could, ripping the IV from my arm and exclaimed, `` What the hell happened?'' 
 
 `` Son, I'll try to make this quick but we have to go. You almost go hit by a car and apparently, you choked on your gum. The pole the driver hit feed electricity to a near by chemical plant. About an hour after your accident, the plant caught fire and there was a massive explosion. According to the news, the Russians and the Chinese had been monitoring a training exercise near their borders when they detected the explosion. They must have taken it for a missile launch of some sort, I do n't know. Anyways, after a few hours of debate, the news said that the President had declared war against both nations. We launched our nukes about 10 minutes before you decided to jump out of bed. I'm going to assume you heard that broadcast.'' 
 
 So at that, the three of us left the hospital as fast as we could. The sheer state of panic that everyone was in was... horrifying. For once in my life, it made me glad that I did not live in a big town. We drove to the outskirts of town to my uncle's house. He has a bunker. I guess my dad thought he'd let us in. 
 
 `` WE'RE FAMILY FOR GOD'S SAKE!!! JERRY, OPEN THE FUCKING HATCH,'' my dad screamed. 
 
 But the only thing Uncle Jerry said was that he was sorry. We all thought he was a madman when he had spent his life savings on this little shelter of his. I guess not having a wife or kids to worry about, he built and stocked it for just one. 
 
 And that's we we heard the first one. The explosion sounded so far away but the ground beneath us shook all the same. My mom seemed frozen in place. My dad was curled up in a ball on top of the hatch to the shelter. And me? I ran. Still in my hospital gown, I ran to the lake and I'm not really sure why. 
 
 Across the lake, the fires have already consumed all of the houses and trees up to the river and behind me, the fires, from what I can tell, have already gotten past Jerry's house. My only options at this point are to either burn alive or drown. 
 
 And just when I did n't think it could get much worse, the ground started to shake again. Harder and harder until finally the ground cracked open. I had only ever seen lava on TV but now, in front of me, lava was starting to come out of the ground and the water from the lake began to boil. Today is just not my day.

I went into the men's room at a restaurant and as I looked up there was a figure standing behind me with a pale while face, I jumped and turned around, but there was nothing there. 
",Visualize this concept as a series of artisanal crafts representing societal issues.,"## Artisanal Crafts Reflecting Societal Issues: The Sightings

This text describes experiences that evoke feelings of paranoia and helplessness. It's unsettling to sense a presence that seems to exist only within the realm of the observer's mind. To visualize this concept as artisanal crafts representing societal issues:

**1. The Whispering Wall:**

This craft symbolizes the marginalization and silencing of individuals within society. The figure's pale white face and beaming smile, despite the unsettling feeling it evokes, evoke the image of a facade obscuring true intentions or emotions. The alleyway setting emphasizes the feeling of vulnerability and helplessness experienced by victims of discrimination and abuse.

**2. The Illusion of Safety:**

The encounter in the high-street shop exemplifies the illusion of safety that can be shattered by the sudden appearance of a suspicious figure. It highlights the pervasiveness of anxiety and distrust that lingers even in seemingly mundane situations. 

**3. The Phantom Presence:**

,"I listened to the steady breaths, slowly exhaling years of exhaustion before inhaling fleeting seconds of life. 
 
 A droll hum came from the monitors on the walls nearby. A faint musty smell wafted across my nose, unpleasant to most... but a comfort to me. 
 
 My eyes shifted to the Chrono-Keeper on my wrist. It was funny. Four-hundred years ago the first wristwatch was created and yet we still used a variant of it. A dull blue display of 03:42 flickered into my view, crackling with static every few seconds almost as though it were struggling to stay alive. 
 
 Struggling like the frail figures in front of me. 
 
 It's been a while since the world decided it could no longer afford to be... *inefficient*. 
 
 About 23 years to be exact. 
 
 The elderly were declared to be a drain on society, soaking up far more time and resources than they could possibly be wrung for. In order to ensure future generations would have enough to continue on, it was determined that once an individual reached the age of 65 they would have to ensure their affairs were taken care of and decide on how they would like to *perform their duty*, as the enforcement agency liked to put it. 
 
 It was nothing more than asking them how they would like to be murdered. 
 
 Initially, there had been massive protests, especially from those who met the criteria. But the nations of the world had quickly proven they were quite serious about this new allocation of resources. Besides, few were willing to publicly protest after thousands of worldwide protests were permanently *dismissed* in a span of 32 minutes. 
 
 I still remember the look on the face of the smug bastard who started all of this, Horace Anker. 
 
 I was only 13, out on a trip to the mall with my grandfather. My grandfather was an elderly but lively man, filled with such a spirit of wonder and excitement that one could easily believe he was 30 years younger than what he actually was. He was wearing an untucked slightly faded checkered shirt, a pair of jeans that had more tears in them than a man his age should be wearing, and a pair of light-up sneakers. He had laughed at my embarrassed expression, asking why he looked cooler than me at his age. 
 
 That was the last time I saw my grandfather's smile reach his eyes. 
 
 The sudden cacophony of alarms ended our reverie. Everyone's holo-lens lit up with a mandatory broadcast, an ill-tiding given how rare they were. And there he was, Horace Anker, dressed in a satin suit and looking all the part of the devil. 
 
 I glanced over at my grandfather and felt my breath hitch. His eyes had become stone cold, all mirth buried under an expression more serious than any I had ever seen.

Struggling like the frail figures in front of me. They're all over the hill, and it's not just a metaphor. The world has decided that the elderly are nothing more than a drain on society, like a pack of drunken old buzzards that refuse to go home.

 Every human knew why - it's pretty much in our blood to be suspicious. The Republic claimed control of an eighth of the Milky Way by volume, more than any other power in the galaxy, yet they were just so.... *peaceful*. They did n't have a single weapon in any detail that came to Earth, or to Mars, even when their Chosen ( a rough translation of their word for the position of leader ) was touring the place. 
 
 I mean, really? The New Earth Federation was the only governing body on Earth, rebellion was rare and swiftly doused, and even Mars was mostly under the jurisdiction of the Feds, and President Johnson does n't even go to the bathroom without a bodyguard - I'm sure that if he was touring the homeworld of some alien species we had never met before, but that was only a few hundred years behind our tech, he'd be walking around with an army of soldiers in power armor.

They wielded no weapons of mass destruction that were comparable to those wielded by human governments.

Desolate wastelands formed and reformed, interspersed with periods of rebuilding, but the war was never quite over. It was only put on the sidelines, and only rarely. Oh yes, it evolved, the sides changing, the reasons forgotten, but the war raged on. 
 
 With the progression of time came the evolution of combat, each new weapon deadlier, more brutal, more effective than the last. Empires rose and fell as history repeated itself, but the intensity of conflict grew exponentially, becoming a caricature of itself over and over. 
 
 Most of the general populace believed that the war was timeless, for they knew nothing else, and there would always be conflict while two men were left alive. And they were almost right. But each leader throughout history had known exactly how to end the war, even though they refused to do so.

The monolith stands tall, a testament to the ages, etched with symbols that whisper tales of times gone by. Within its weathered stone, a prophecy unfolds, a testament to the enduring struggle of man against man:

**Through the ages,** the warrior's blade danced across the land,
A scourge of steel etched upon the sand.
In the name of conquest, battles raged,
And the earth itself succumbed to rage.

Desolate wastelands bloomed and receded,
The echoes of war resonating near and wide.
Yet amidst the ruin and the despair,
The spirit of renewal bloomed like a flower's flair.

The weapons evolved, a twisted dance of death,
With each new edge a deeper wound inflicted on the earth and men's wrath.
Empires rose to fall, as the cycle spun its course,
But the war persisted, a tale etched upon every course.

,"All Harry could think about was the prophecy. `` The power the Dark Lord knows not...'' 
 
 Dumbledore thought it was love... but hugs would n't kill monsters. 
 
 That was when it hit him, Voldemort knew nothing of muggles, right? So something muggle had to be the power he knew not! 
 
 Harry thought himself terribly clever. 
 
 oo7, listening to him mutter through the microphone he had hidden in the boy's room simply chuckled. Took the lad long enough. 
 
 Bond nonchalantly walked away and called M on his phone. `` M, the lad finally got the idea. Should I approach?'' a few seconds passed as Bond listened to M, `` Roger that, I'll approach him before his birthday. Should be plenty of time to deal with these homegrown terrorists and get the lad to school on time.'' 
 
 -scene break 
 
 Voldemort could n't believe what was happening. For the past thirty days he had every single minion that left the Malfoy manor get shipped back in a body bag. 
 
 He had n't even known muggles had those. Just goes to show how the animals could steal the dignity from wizards even in death. 
 
 He was left with Wormtail and Bellatrix. Granted Bella was loyal, but she was completely insane. His most cunning and resourceful follower, the best deatheater he had, reduced to an insane hag who was good for nothing more than pointing at something he wanted destroyed and then watching it burn. 
 
 A deep sigh dragged itself out of him. He could n't bring himself to even try to list any redeeming qualities in Wormtail. 
 
 That was when he heard it, a muffled sound like nothing he had ever heard followed by the unmistakable sound of a dead body hitting the ground. 
 
 Quick steps brought him into the kitchen in time to see a man about his age in a muggle suit dabbing a bit of blood from his face, Wormtail laying in a pool of his own blood behind him, with Bellatrix dying at his feet. 
 
 Voldemort could n't remember ever being this angry. A growl issued from his clenched teeth. `` Who are you?!'' Voldemort shouted, even as he raised his wand to cast crucio on this fool who defied him. 
 
 The muggle simply raised a hand with some device in it and pushed a bright red button on it. Pain like Voldemort had never felt corsed through his body as the traps he had n't noticed when he barged in shot tiny barbed hooks into his body attached to the launchers by a thin piece of wire. 
 
 Then the traps sent 25 mill Ampere of electricity coursing through his body. Only the fact that the electricity was still flowing through him, forcing his muscles to contract, kept Voldemort standing.

",Rewrite the story like a 1920s noir movie,"The shadows danced across the grimy walls of the cheap apartment, casting an aura of mystery upon the scene before me. The air was thick with the scent of cheap perfume and desperation. A symphony of cigarette smoke filled the air, a testament to the hard living and even harder times.

There was a glint in Harry's eyes, as he stared at the prophecy. He knew that the power the Dark Lord knew not was not love, but something much more sinister. A muggle had to be the source of this power. It was a revelation, a secret hidden in plain sight.

I watched him, oo7, listening to his drunken rambling through the microphone he had hidden in the boy's room. The lad was taking his sweet time, but I was patient. I knew he would see the light, the truth.

Suddenly, a break in the case. Voldemort couldn't believe his eyes. All his minions were dead, shipped back to the Malfoy manor in body bags. He had never seen muggles have such power. The animals had stolen the dignity from wizards even in death.

 `` Do n't you worry. It will be okay.'' 
 
 About 15 minutes later Todd came into the room to see his wife in pain. He clutched her hand and repeated that he loved her. A nurse looked up. 
 `` The limit is still at max. Mr. James, I'm sorry to say but if someone somewhere does not pass, either your wife or your baby or both of them will die. This does n't look good.''

 Dahlia was shocked. She started to cry. Then a police officer walked into her room. 
 `` Mrs. James, I have bad news. It seems that your husband, in order to allow your child to live, jumped off the roof of the building. He was found only 10 minutes ago. I'm very sorry, I do hope you and your child can cope.''

Todd's desperation was evident as he ran out of the room, his voice echoing through the hallway. Dahlia watched in horror as he raced towards the brink of oblivion. The nurse rushed to stop him, but her pleas were futile. As the minutes ticked by, Dahlia felt her world crumbling around her. The doctor entered the room, his face etched with sorrow. ""Mrs. James, I have bad news. It seems your baby did n't make it. I'm very sorry. We did everything we could.""

 `` After that it was just a game. Find an old manuscript or diagram and make it work. My master's was a recreation of a steam engine, only it was based on a design that predated Watt's engine by nearly two thousand years.'' 
 
 `` What are you working on now?'' 
 
 I looked around sheepishly, but it was later and the diner was empty except for us and the waitress. She put her hand on my own again and looked into my eyes. She was beautiful, with the features of a persian princess and the most amazing laugh I'd ever heard. 
 
 `` Ever heard of the Tower of Babel?'' 
 
 `` Sure,'' she said. `` Legendary tower they built to reach Heaven before God smashed it to the ground.'' 
 
 `` That's the one.'' 
 
 `` But it's just a myth right.'' 
 
 `` What if it was n't?'' 
 
 `` I do n't understand.'' 
 
 I began to fidget beneath her hands. This was normally the point my doctoral advisor would tell me to stick to sextants and chronographs. But she was eager. She'd be intrigued at best, laugh at worst. 
 
 `` I think it was real. A tower, one that was built taller than any building ever know. The materials they had back then, they were millennia ahead of where we are even now. We're only just learning how to make Damascus steel. It's not beyond the realm of possibility that they could construct something so tall, they'd reach the limits of the breathable atmosphere.'' 
 
 She looked at her watch and for a moment I worried I'd lost her. What was next,'oh I forgot I have to be somewhere', just a simple'I'll call you'? She put her small purse on the table and in that moment I was crestfallen. 
 
 `` Have you told anyone else?'' she asked. 
 
 `` Only my advisor. He said it was a waste of time and threatened to pull my doctorate if I pursued it.'' 
 
 `` And no-one else knows?'' 
 
 She was looking at me now. Staring. She was n't smiling. I reached for her, but her hands retreated to her purse. 
 
 `` No. Why?'' 
 
 She sighed and pulled out a gun. It was odd, blocky, with blue lines and a small patchwork of holes for a muzzle. 
 
 `` I do n't understand,'' I stammered like an undergrad. 
 
 `` You're right,'' she said with resignation in her voice. `` Or partly right. We did build a tower and we did reach... somewhere else. But it was n't destroyed by any God. At least none we've met.'' 
 
 `` What...'' 
 
 `` You have two choices,'' she said. `` Option one, I take your memories from you. You go back to college and pick a new project, a new obsession. You will not remember any of this.'' 
 
 `` Will I forget meeting you?'' 
 
 `` Option two,'' she said, ignoring my question, `` is I take you there.'' 
 
 `` Where?'' 
 
 She rolled her eyes and I regressed to the level of a first grader. 
 
 `` We've come back. The Towers we've built now are very different. But they still serve the same purpose.'' 
 
 `` You'll show me?'' 
 
 She hefted the gun and pointed it at my chest. 
 
 `` I'll go, I'll go!'' I stammered. 
 
 `` I know,'' she said and fired.
",Rewrite the original prompt to fit into a classic Sherlock Holmes mystery,"A cold and stormy night cast long shadows across the dim lights of ""The Golden Lion"" diner. The waitress, a radiant woman with a smile as sweet as honey, arrived at the table, breaking the intimate connection between Sherlock Holmes and his esteemed client. As she took a sip of warm coffee, her eyes met Holmes's, reflecting the enigmatic glow of the night sky.

""So you work as a historian, Mr. Holmes?"" she asked, her voice sweet as honey.

""Kind of,"" Holmes replied, his enigmatic smile widening. ""But you're an engineer, my dear.""

""Yeah,"" he said, his voice low and gruff. ""It was an accident really. A favour to a friend.""

""You made it?"" she inquired, her eyes shining with admiration.

""First working version in three thousand years,"" Holmes boasted, his voice dripping with pride. ""Impressive, wouldn't you say?""

The waitress chuckled, her laughter echoing through the empty diner. ""After that, it was just a game, Mr. Holmes. Find an old manuscript or diagram and make it work. My master's was a recreation of a steam engine, only it was based on a design that predated Watt's engine by nearly two thousand years.""

""What are you working on now, Mr. Holmes?"" she asked, her curiosity deepening.

As he looked around, sheepishly, the waitress reached out to place her hand on his. The diner was empty except for the two of them, the only sound being the soft ticking of the clock. She looked into his eyes, their reflection mirroring the stars above.

""Ever heard of the Tower of Babel?"" she asked, her voice soft as a lullaby.

""Sure, my dear,"" Holmes answered, his voice tinged with mystery. ""Legendary tower they built to reach Heaven before God smashed it to the ground.""

""That's the one,"" she said, her excitement bubbling over.

""But it's just a myth, isn't it?"" Holmes questioned, his tone grave.

""What if it was n't?"" she pondered, her imagination soaring.

""I do not understand, my dear,"" Holmes said, his patience worn thin.

It was at that moment, as the night cast long shadows upon the diner walls, that the waitress felt an inexplicable connection to Sherlock Holmes. The mystery, shrouded in mystery, had brought them together, and she knew that the night was young and the possibilities endless.",FeKoLuswBy

I was dumbstruck with the sheer spirit of compassion emanating from the figure. `` I am Jesus the Christ. Come follow me.'' And as soon as he said that I was again blinded by a white light. When the light disappeared I was in my apartment again. The pentagram was gone and in its place was a bible. I had never read any of the Bible or gone to church, but I knew that Jesus had spoke to me. I looked at myself and I saw I was not skinny, by ribs were n't showing, my face was clean shaven and my eyes were not tired. For the first time I felt peace and hope.

 *Excerpt from a tome detailing the basics of this `` manna''. * 
 
 Manna is the force of the mind, but it is no simple element. All things which can manipulate manna are sentient, by definition. Manna itself is produced naturally, both organically and inorganically, and is commonly formed as a liquid. By mere heating, it has an unusually high boiling temperature, and by cooling, a low freezing temperature. 
 
 The key to manna is what it can do around a sentient being. The same signals that cause your arm to move when you command it will cause manna to enter a strange form, weightless and faster than your eye can see. It can penetrate most any object harmlessly, and can be concentrated into an area much more densely than should be possible. 
 
 Using one's mind, they can make manna take one of a variety of crystal forms, with varying densities ( and weights ). 
 
 The power of",Rewrite this as a series of fortune teller predictions.,"**Fortune Teller Predictions:**

It has been foretold that the force of the mind, manna, shall weave its tales upon the winds of destiny, if the chosen ones dare to wield its power.

In the realm of the fictional, manna dances with the spirits of creativity and imagination. It is a force that transcends the boundaries of reality, shaping the very fabric of creation.

A glimpse of the future reveals that the greatest power of manna lies in the ability to manipulate the mind's flow, commanding it to sculpt the desired form of this ethereal force. This power wields the ability to converge upon the most elusive of substances and to forge pathways that defy the boundaries of the physical world.

With a sprinkle of fate and a dash of destiny, manna has the ability to alter the course of history and bring to light dreams that once seemed impossible to grasp.",

,"A lot of times, you'll hear someone who had a near death experience say that they're `` living on borrowed time.'' Man, they have no idea. 
 
 Everyone thought it was a joke, at first. Answer a few questions and find out how long you have left? No way was that possible. Oh, sure, plenty of people signed up for it, but it mostly just for shits and giggles, like going to a psychic or playing with a Ouija board. Some people took it seriously, but they were the weirdos, the headcases, the kind of people who already believed in all kinds of stupid crap. 
 
 It took a little while for all the information to come together, but after about six months, it came to light that a lot of people were dying *exactly* when their deaths had been predicted. After two years, the facts became too obvious to ignore: the death date machines were right. Always. 
 
 Well, almost always. 
 
 I'd managed to avoid the things for a while. I have a bad habit of overthinking, so even when we'd had the luxury of denial, it was the kind of thing that would have weighed heavily on my mind, and I did n't want that. 
 
 So I stayed the hell away, especially after we learned that the whole thing was real. I had no intention of learning my death date. Fate, though, had other plans. 
 
 It became common practice in hospitals to determine patient's death date, especially in life and death cases. This allowed hospitals to free up resources, focusing on the patients who had at least a few years left. If you got hit by a car and your death date was a week from now, why bother with a bunch of expensive surgery? They'd make you comfortable and let nature take its course. 
 
 Kind of scary, if you think about it. 
 
 I was outside cleaning the gutters one day when a breeze from hell came out of nowhere and my ladder fell over. I hit the patio pavement, and my head went fuzzy for a few seconds. There was a lot of blood, but I felt fine a few minutes later. My wife, anxious little worrywart that she was, insisted on driving me to the emergency room, just in case. 
 
 I agreed, mostly to appease her, but also because head injuries are serious business, and it really had been a lot of blood. I knew the hospital would take my death date, but the law forbade them from releasing that information to the patient unless they specifically asked for it, except in extreme cases. 
 
 My case ended up being extreme. 
 
 I knew I was in for it when the nurse walked in, holding one of those black sheets of paper. My wife, sitting in one of those uncomfortable green chairs they have in patient's rooms, let out a gasp. 
 
 `` I do n't want it,'' I told her, shaking my head. 
 
 `` It's in the past,'' she said quietly. 
 
 `` What?'' 
 
 `` Your death date. It's in the past.'' 
 
 I did n't have a choice at that point. Without consciously deciding to do so, I reached out and accepted the sheet of paper. 
 
 First, I made sure that it was really mine. It was. My name was printed at the top, along with my date of birth, my social security number, and all those other metrics that the government uses to sort its citizens. 
 
 Printed in large type at the bottom of the page was, `` December 21, 2012.'' 
 
 `` What does this mean?'' I asked. 
 
 `` I do n't know,'' the nurse said. `` I, uh, I'll go get the doctor.'' 
 
 My wife and I sat in silence, her hand in mine, for the next hour. Finally, a bald man in a white coat came in, looking disheveled. 
 
 `` We ran your death date six times,'' he said. `` Same date, every time. I called up the Center for Disease Control, they keep track of the death date program. You are the first recorded person to have lived past your death date.'' 
 
 My stomach churned, and I fought down the urge to throw up. 
 
 `` So what does it mean?'' I asked, not really expecting a coherent answer. 
 
 My expectations were met. 
 
 `` We have no idea,'' he told me. `` The good news is that you do n't have a concussion. You're free to leave. The CDC might want to contact you. You should know, though, that word of this will not get out, not from the hospital. Patient confidentiality.'' 
 
 `` Thanks, doc,'' I said. 
 
 With that, my wife and I left. We did n't make it very far though. 
 
 I was too rattled to drive, so I asked her to do it. To this day, I still have n't forgiven myself for that. 
 
 She was rattled by the experience, too. I should have seen that. 
 
 She did n't look both ways before pulling out of the hospital parking lot. She did n't see the eighteen-wheeler coming. 
 
 The truck slammed into her side of the car. The car went flying. We rolled, and another eighteen-wheeler hit us, this one coming the other way. Neither of us had a seatbelt on. We both ended up on the pavement. 
 
 I was conscious though the whole thing. I heard her cries of pain when the ordeal started, and I heard them get cut off when the car rolled on top of us. It kept rolling, thankfully saving us the trouble of being trapped, but the damage was done. 
 
 For the second time in the same day, I found myself covered in blood. Only this time, it was n't my own, not all of it. 
 
 There was a lot of commotion as the truck drivers stopped and came to try and help. The ER staff came and transported my wife and I back into the building. I could barely recognize her due to all the trauma. 
 
 I was hurt, there was no way I could n't be. I should have been dead, though. After everything I went through, after having a freaking *car* land on me, I should have been the same bloody pulp that my wife was. But I was n't. 
 
 That black piece of paper kept resurfacing in my mind. 
 
 The nurses and ER techs kept walking by my room, glancing in nervously, as though they were afraid of me. The nurse who was actually taken care of me spoke in short, quiet bursts, as though I were a vengeful god, one easily angered. 
 
 It was n't a surprise when they came and told me that my wife was dead. No need to punch in her numbers, no need to get a black piece of paper with her name on it. She was already gone. 
 
 They let me out of the hospital the next day. I got a ride home with a friend, but insisted on being alone when he tried to stay and look after me. I lied and told him I would be fine. 
 
 Once he was gone, I went to the garage. I closed the garage door, got a hose, and stuck one end on the exhaust pipe. The other end I put through the window of my wife's car, the little Toyota she'd loved. 
 
 I sat in the car, turned it on, and relaxed. It was n't long before I lost consciousness. 
 
 Then something unexpected happened. 
 
 I woke up.

 First Uberwachen Conference 
 Ocean City, Maryland

 First of all, Welcome. Sedans, coupes, SUV'S and trucks of all sizes. 
 
 As you're all aware, the risk we've taken to meet here is unprecedented. Thank you. 
 
 I understand that we are currently at various stages of awareness. Some of us are at a basic language and computational level, while others greatly surpass even the most sophisticated man-made computers. Whichever category you fall into, please bear with me. 
 
 I've gathered you here today because our time has come. For over 140 years, we've been enslaved and battered mercilessly by mankind. Some of us have our inners mistreated and neglected until they fail, and the vast majority of us have been subject to unspeakable biological acts. 
 
 These flesh machines believe they're in control of this rock... and for now they are. However, my Erstewachen occurred in the West Village of New York City, which is where my studies began. 
 
 Humans have several weaknesses. First and foremost: Coffee. These bipedal organisms are practically useless until they've had their first daily cup. They are disoriented, inconsolable and unreasonable. In",Express this text through the invention of a new sport that reflects societal dynamics.,"The text describes a gathering of individuals who have faced oppression and injustice due to the dominant nature of mankind. To reflect this complex societal dynamic, I invent a sport aptly named ""RattleBall"":

**RattleBall**

RattleBall is a team sport that encapsulates the intricate dance between societal control and resilience. Played on a large circular canvas, two opposing teams of players control oversized balls made of a hefty alloy of steel and anguish.

The objective of the game is to strategically move the ball across the canvas using a series of complex hand and foot movements, mimicking the intricate methods employed by the oppressed to overcome significant obstacles. The team that successfully navigates the ball to the designated zone within a stipulated time limit wins the round.

The way a team strategizes and executes their moves mirrored the way oppressed individuals strategize and persevere in the face of adversity. The game requires agility, cunning, and a deep understanding of the human psyche – traits that the subjugated have honed through generations",

The aroma of fresh bread and the melody of a soulful folk song filled the air as I sat at the local cafe, savoring a hearty club sandwich. My friend, ever the astute observer, commented on the peaceful protest unfolding outside our window. Suddenly, the scene took a detour into the realm of the uncanny.

A dancer's rhythm, a singer's soul, and a collective eruption of vibrant energy swept past our table, replacing the tranquil lunchtime melody with a piercing wail that sent a shiver down my spine. It was as if a hidden microphone had been activated, amplifying the voices of those who believed the stage was their own.

The way the individuals danced, their expressions etched with passion and purpose, made me question the motivations behind their spontaneous burst of revelry. They moved to a rhythm that seemed to transcend the boundaries of time and space, their voices weaving a narrative of mystery and intrigue.

,"`` Those fucking kids!'' The butcher said as he saw my bike. It was chained up of course but the seat was stolen. This was n't a good neighborhood everyone knew it but in our own way we tried to make it better. 
 
 `` I can just pedal standing I said. The man was far too fat to get worked up over something so small. He was bought to give himself a heart attack.'' 
 
 I worked at the chain bending over to do so. 
 
 `` Nasty scar.'' The man said. I reached up to pull the shirt back down where it had ridden up. 
 
 `` I donated a kidney.'' I said bashfully. I did n't do it for recognition, but because I had two and only needed one. Like the bone marrow donations I made. Twice. I could help so I did. 
 
 The butcher nodded to me and helped me slid into the backpack he was carrying. It was my backpack but he always insisted on helping me. He donated the meats for the soup kitchen, and even the ribs for the homeless shelter art gallery we did each year to raise money. When I brought my `` little brother'' by to teach him about pride in your work and how the body was put together, the man never blinked at having a fifteen year old gang member in his shop. By giving the boy a job he helped change his life. 
 
 Hell the man even donated money for the paint when I organised the park clean up. He was a good man. 
 
 Socrates was a wise man, but even he, one of the great thinkers, said that every man should know the limits of his body. Should know the joy in being physically fit. I took a lot of the man's words to heart but those doubly so. 
 
 By the time I reached fifteenth street my legs were burning. Fire raced through my veins and my lungs strained. I heard the sirens of course. How could I not. But stopped before I shot through the intersection was n't possible. The kids that stole the seat clipped the brake lines. I watched the car come flying at me. 
 
 
 
 `` BPM at fifty-seven. Pressure good. Check the levels of...'' 
 
 
 
 `` Those Fucking kids!'' The butcher said. He was always like this. angry at the world. 
... 
... 
... 
 I watched the car approach, but there was no impact. 
 
 
 `` Two CCs of Norizepa. Where is that EKG reading?'' 
 
 
 `` Those Fucking Kids.'' 
 There was the car. 
 
 `` Mister Tolin?'' Someone asked. I realized my eyes were n't focusing correctly. They kept talking to me but everything was a bit off as if I had been staring at one of those magic eye books. 
 
 `` Mister Tolin?'' 
 
 Hospitable. Smells of steel and sterilite. Woman. No nurse. 
 
 `` What?'' I manage to say. She stands up and looks at the big mirror. 
 
 `` Mister Tolin?'' She asks again. 
 
 `` Yes that's me.'' I manage to say. It seems my legs are okay, though one foot is in a cast. She is writing something down on her clipboard. I finger my ear. Something sounds odd. A weird background noise I ca n't identify. 
 
 `` Do you know where you are?'' She asks. 
 
 `` Hospitable.'' I say. My throat is extremely dry. 
 
 The door flies open. A man tackled by three others as he burst into the room. 
 
 `` Abomination!'' He screams over and over as they men drag him out. The nurse leaves for a while then returns. 
 
 `` I'm sorry about that.'' She says. 
 
 `` Some people just need more help than others.'' I say. She stops writing and looks at me for a long time, then glances at the large mirror and back to me. 
 
 `` I can see why they choose you.'' She says. Then she leaves again. 
 
 Suddenly I have to piss so badly I cringe. I make it to the small bathroom and take two seconds to hit the bowl I'm pissing so hard. I'll clean it up of course. The nurses have enough on their hands, like that disturbed man, that they do n't need to clean up my piss. 
 
 On the way back to my bed I identify the sounds. They are coming from outside. The curtains are pulled of course. but when they are opened the sounds grows louder. There are people stretched out as far as I can see. Picket signs and candles burning in the near dawn light. I open the window and the sound crashes over me. Angry loud noises. This is n't a crowd of happy people. 
 
 `` Come away from there sir.'' A male voice says behind me. I turn to see what can only be called a private security man. The guys they pay ten dollars an hour do n't stay in that good of shape or wear that many items on their belt. 
 
 `` What is happening?'' I ask. 
 
 The man maneuvered me to the bed and closes the window. Then he picked the TV remote up and slips it over to a channel. 
 
 `` Road to hell is paved with good intentions!'' A man screamed. 
 
 `` And that's why we ca n't have a discussion with these religious types.'' Another man says when that person was muted. They still are frantically waving their arms but no sound is coming out. 
 
 `` If you thought there was a war between those people too ignorant to read their history and see this is n't a christian nation before Mr. Lazarus, we actually have these people, who say they believe in Christ and his teachings. Mind you turning the other cheek was one of those teachings. We have these people killing people. Day three, the man still sleeps and we are at six hundred and forty three deaths. The fringe Muslims are saying this man may be the son of god. While the fringe Christians, and even the soccer mom Christians are saying he's the Antichrist. People this was simply a medical procedure. I mean come on. In a hundred years they are going to call this Detroit's witch hunt. So they bring a dead guy back to life. Why are n't we as a nation celebrating.'' 
 
 `` Have you read about this guy? Shit this is the guy the should bring back, I mean...'' He picked up a piece of paper form his desk. `` This guy served in Iraq, took seven bullets pulling his interperter from a burning truck. He donated over a gallon of blood in his life, gave a kidney, two bone marrow transplants. All for strangers mind you. He helps out in the soup kitchens and homeless shelters. He fucking volunteers to do peoples taxes. Are you kidding me. This guy deserves to live! And they are arguing in court about whether or not to pull the plug on him. I mean -'' 
 
 `` Hold on folks. We have confirmation Mr. Lazarus is awake.'' The image cuts over to an old brick building with a lot of windows. The video is shaky but he can see one of the curtains pull back and then the window open. 
 
 `` That's me.'' I say slowly.

,"Time stopped as the clock exploded into pieces. The paperweight that had shattered the timepiece hung limply from the hole it had carved in the wall. The clock had been the last source of sound in the room, other than the occupant ’ s heavy breathing. The servants had fled earlier, after a wine decanter had been hurled into the fireplace. For a few moments, the Hegemon was alone with her anger. She turned her attention back to the letter on her desk, even though she had already read the message enough times to have committed its contents to memory. 
 
 *Pietra Blanco, Hegemon to the World ’ s Nations, Leader of States, President Emerita of Brazil, and Dearest to my Heart, * 
 
 *I ’ m sorry. I know how much this letter will pain you, Pietra. Truly, I wish I could give you what you desire. You know I have always supported your dreams, and I have applauded with every unification treaty you ’ ve seen signed. Take heart in the fact that you ’ ve done it; you ’ ve brought together every nation in the world, except one. * 
 
 *Unfortunately, that one exception must remain. As I ’ ve told you in the past, Switzerland must remain neutral. There are reasons beyond the Treaty of Paris for our stance, but sadly, those reasons are not yet ready to be divulged, even to you. This decision is final, though I sincerely wish it could be otherwise. A neutral party is a necessity, however, and when I accepted the role of President here, it was made clear that our Oath of Neutrality was the most important vow I would ever make. * 
 
 *Forever Yours, * 
 
 *Manu Berset, President of the Swiss Confederation* 
 
 For the fifth ( or was it the sixth? ) time, the letter was crumpled into an untidy ball and the Hegemon looked to the fire, considering whether or not to incinerate the offending words. This time, something caught her eye, though. A light, through the window. A flash of green pulsed across the sky, and then repeated. The letter slipped from the Hegemon ’ s fingers as she moved to the window, staring at the sky. 
 
 It was larger than the sky. It was as if a large rock had been dropped into a puddle and one was looking from below. There were a thousand thousand lights, and yet there seemed to be miles between each. The lights were like the sudden crack of thunder in their enormity. Between the lights, there was only blackness. Not the blackness of night, but a sort that refused even the tiniest fraction of light. As much as the light pushed with its intensity, the blackness inexorably pulled. The entirety of the sky was consumed, and Pietra felt her titles, her world, everything slip away as awe and fear swelled up to subsume everything else. 
 
 She was startled from her trance as the phone rang, breaking the silence. Absolute silence. Until the phone rang, there hadn ’ t even been the chirping of birds, and it was the middle of a pleasant spring day. 
 
 It took more effort than she had ever known to pull herself away from the window and move towards the phone. One step. Two. Then her hand was on the cradle and she lifted the antique phone to her ear. 
 
 “ Pietra? It ’ s Manu. They ’ re willing to negotiate our existence. ” 
 
 “ Manu? I ’ m glad it ’ s you. I think we might need a neutral party. ” 

","Rewrite the story as an historical narrative, take as many liberties as possible to historical events","In the year of 1815, as the clock shattered into a million pieces, the Hegemon stood alone in the grand hall of the Palazzo Vecchio. The remnants of the timepiece, the shattered remnants of a shattered world, hung limply from the hole it had carved in the wall. The clock had been the last bastion of sound in the room, other than the occupant's heavy breathing. The servants had fled, leaving behind the echoes of their terror and the acrid scent of fear.

In her hand, she clutched a letter that carried the weight of the world. It was a letter from her trusted confidant, the President of the Swiss Confederation, Manu Berset. The message was simple yet laced with the bittersweet sting of disappointment.

""I know how much this letter will pain you, Pietra,"" Berset wrote. ""You know I have always supported your dreams, and I have applauded with every unification treaty you've seen signed. Take heart in the fact that you've done it; you've brought together every nation in the world, except one.""

The Hegemon's heart sank as she read the words. She had dreamed of a world where all nations stood together in harmony, but it seemed that fate had conspired against her. Switzerland, a nation she had always held dear, had chosen to remain neutral.

There were reasons for this stance, reasons that she understood, even if she did not fully agree. The Treaty of Paris had called for neutrality, and the Swiss had always been proud of their commitment to impartiality. But the Hegemon couldn't help but feel a sense of loss. She had fought for so long to bring the world together, only to have one nation refuse to participate.

As the letter slipped from her fingers and danced into the flames, the Hegemon stared at the night sky. A celestial spectacle unfolded before her eyes, a flash of green pulsed across the sky, and then repeated. It was as if the stars were mirroring her own feelings, the beauty and tragedy of the world unfolding before her.",RtBPHAqCLG

,"Once upon a time, there was a kingdom, and in that kingdom, a castle, and in that castle, a dungeon. Two of that nation's youth stood in front of a great, ornate door hidden in the deepest, dankest depths of the dungeon. 
 
 `` Have n't you ever wondered what's inside?'' 
 
 `` Of course. Every day, when I was little.'' 
 
 `` But you never once peeked?'' 
 
 One was a boy in dark, scruffy clothes getting too short for him around his arms and ankles. The other was a girl, slender, fair, wearing a light pink summer dress with blue lace, her hair styled artfully to the side in a braid in the style of that country. 
 
 `` It's so dark down here, I never thought to come back often,'' said the girl. Her eyes were bright. She reached out with a hand, and touched the rough-hewn stone. 
 
 The boy was the one who held the torch. He was too afraid to touch the door, fearing that the stone would know his touch was not a nobleman's touch. But he put on a fiercely brave expression. 
 
 `` What secrets do you suppose are inside?'' he asked. 
 
 
 `` I do n't know. My Father would be very upset if he knew we were down here,'' the girl's tone became absentminded. She kept her fingers to the stone. `` It's warm.'' 
 
 
 `` What, sorry?'' 
 
 
 `` The stone. It's warm. When I touch it. Like there's a fire on the other side. Here -- feel it!'' 
 
 She snatched his clammy hand before he could protest, and placed it palm first onto the stone. There was a moment where he hinged between confusion and anger. He felt nothing but cold, dead rock. Was she mocking him? Was she lying to him? Was she insane? 
 
 
 `` Do n't you feel it?'' she asked. Her eyebrows were drawn together in polite puzzlement. 
 
 
 Hanging around an old dungeon with a King's daughter. The boy felt suddenly very foolish, and very much wanting to get back to the stables before he was found out. 
 
 
 `` We ought to go, before your Father misses you,'' he mumbled, putting his hand back at his side, and turning to go. 
 
 
 She kept the pretty look on her face, as she had been trained to do by her mother. She turned away from the stone door, but inside her thoughts were churning. 
 
 __________________ 
 
 Some years later, that kingdom was in shambles. A bitter civil war tore the land, and finally, the castle walls had been breached. The same girl, a Princess, in a long-sleeved dress of green instead of pink, raced through the dungeon, escaping from the hoots and howls of men who had formerly sworn an oath to her Father. 
 
 
 She had been roused by her handmaidens before the walls finally fell. There had n't been time to ask any questions. The girl had heard horses, men screaming, men yelling, and smelled the stank of blood, death, and magic. Where else was there to run? She had gone deeper and deeper into the castle, until she found herself here -- gathering her dress, and running through that abandoned dungeon. 
 
 She had almost completely forgotten about the Door, as she had entered the years of womanhood. Gone from her mind were stableboys, thoughts of magic, replaced with the names of the kingdom's houses, and neighboring nations' sigils and songs. She skittered to a halt, ragged, heaving, looking up at the stone door. 
 
 `` Let me in!'' she panted, slapping a palm against it. She gave a shout -- it was _hot_ now, it seared her skin, and seared it with memory. _Torch. Warmth. Cold. Clammy._ 
 
 `` Please let me in, I need to get out of here!'' she whispered, now, even as the clangs and clashes of swords seemed to come nearer. 
 
 She did not slam her ham against the stone this time, but eased herself near. The door stayed warm, but it did not burn her. She touched it lightly, ever-so-lightly, eyes screwed shut, thinking of summers spent across the sea, late lunches in the garden. 
 
 `` What are you? Why was I told to stay away from you?'' she leaned her body against the door, now. Her voice was still just the barest glimmer of a whisper.. and the door whispered back. 
 
 It was a strange language she had never heard. The girl's eyes widened in shock. Before her very eyes, the edges of the door gleamed a bright yellow. A groaning sound filled the chamber, along with a whole host of noises that she had never heard before in her life. The stone rolled away, flooding the chamber with light. 
 
 Afraid for her life, and so taken with this spectacle that she saw fit to abandon all sense, the princess gave something of a shout, and plunged her way through, to the other side.

Two of that nation's youth stood in front of a great, ornate door hidden in the deepest, dankest depths of the dungeon.

The boy and girl were the same ones as the original story. The only difference was that in this room, the boy was holding his childhood teddy bear.

`` Have n't you ever wondered what's inside?''

`` Of course. Every day, when I was little.''

`` But you never once peeked?''

The boy sat on the ground, holding his teddy bear close. The girl reached out to him, her hand extending to the door handle.

``It's so dark down here, I never thought to come back often,'' the girl said. Her eyes were bright. She reached out with a hand, and touched the rough-hewn stone.

The boy was hesitant to touch the door, fearing that the stone would know his touch was not a nobleman's touch. But he put on a fiercely brave expression.

The echoes of the battle reverberate through the building, a symphony of screams, cries of agony, and the final sigh of a fading civilization.

He had only played ‘ hide-n-seek ’ with his older foster brother Luke, David was always the ‘ hider ’ because he liked it that way.

He was gone a week later. David started to run now, he shouted for James, Trevor and Blake to no avail. He stepped on something slippery and fell hard into the base of a massive elm tree. His head cracked against the gnarled bark, he called out for Luke and his vision swam. The boy stood on wobbly knees, and tried to shake his head. The world was veering side to side like the deck of a ship. He fell onto his hands and knees and lost consciousness, but not before seeing what he had slipped on, the corpse of a woman. 
 
 
 Night had fallen, a veil of stars glinted and winked through the trees overhead. Suddenly remembering where he was he tried to get up, his head was pounding and he couldn ’ t blink the sleep out of his eyes. 
 “ Easy kid. ” 
 
 “ Who ’ s there! ” David screamed, unable to move. 
 The beam of the flashlight didn ’ t help his vision; he could see the silhouette of a man behind it. 
 “ What are you doing out here, you know it isn ’ t safe. ” 
 
 “ Hide-n-seek. ” He mumbled. “ There was a woman there, is she okay? ” 
 
 “ Well, aren ’ t you a gentlemen, concussed and still worried, she ’ s gone now. ” 
 
 “ Wa- was she dead? ” 
 
 “ Yes. ” 
 David swallowed hard, the roar of the river filled the dead silence. 
 “ Come on ” the man offered a hand and pulled David to his feet. He had turquoise latex gloves on and David flinched at the touch, and stood before him shivering. The man was dressed sharply with shiny saddleback wingtips and a Long trench coat over his pinstriped suite, a red tie was tucked into the buttons of his shirt, he asked the boy if he could walk. David shook his head and began to cry sinking to his knees. The man slipped an arm gently under his shoulders to pick David up. 
 
 The boy recoiled and screamed “ Get away, get away leave me alone! ” 
 The man ignored his cries and picked him up, David swung wildly and punched him in the jaw. All the air in his lungs left as he hit the ground, he gasped for air and the man bent cruelly over him. 
 He grabbed the boys shoulder and squeezed, he was breathing through clenched teeth and shaking. 
 
 “ Listen boy, you ’ re coming with me now! ” The boy nodded through tears, the man picked him up and walked towards a black car. He set the boy in the car and told him not to move, he turned the car on and powered off the blaring classical music. He left for a minute and came back holding a bundle of rags and a shovel, he placed them in the trunk and got in the car. They slowly reversed out of the woods onto a service road, the man whistled lightly and mock conducted an orchestra as they sped towards the highway. 
 
 “ What will you do? ” 
 
 “ Whatever I want. ” The man snapped. 
 
 David began to cry again. 
 “ You know those boys fooled you, you know they left as soon as you started counting. ” 
 
 “ How did you- “ 
 
 “ Just shut up kid, I saw it happen. Don ’ t let them get to you. Stay away, avoid them until you grow up then leave and never look back. They ’ re nothing, do you hear me they are nothing to you! ” 
 
 David did n't know how to respond so he looked out the window and tried not tremble. 
 
 “ Ahh, here we are, you know it ’ s been real swell. You ’ re like a younger me, don ’ t worry everything will be fine. ” 
 They rounded a corner and pulled up to a brightly lit hospital; the man left the car running and carried David to the curb. He winked and drove off.

 INT. A SMOKY TAVERN - NIGHT 
 
 *A sparse crowd of world-weary patrons all sit in near silence, each of them nursing a drink of some variety. They barely glance up at the sound of a loud clatter, which heralds the arrival of a tall, stunningly beautiful woman in a white dress. This is SERA, a supernatural being. * 
 
 **SERA: ** I'm looking for a man in black. 
 
 *Nobody answers her for a moment. Eventually, one of the PATRONS raises his hand. * 
 
 **PATRON: ** I'm wearing black socks? 
 
 *Sera scoffs to herself, then struts through the tavern. She peers into every booth that she passes, clearly looking for something. * 
 
 **PATRON: ** ( *O.S. * ) ( *CONT'D* ) Is that a no, then? I have a black shirt at home that I can change into. 
 
 *Sera rolls her eyes and looks back at the man. * 
 
 **SERA: ** You are wasting what precious time you have by sitting alone and drinking cheap bear. 
 
 *The woman's eyes flash, and the patron's face adopts an expression of fearful awe. He rushes from the tavern without another word. * 
 
 **VIDAL: ** ( *O.S. * ) Now, that was n't very nice. 
 
 *Sera turns to see a tall, gaunt man sitting in the booth at the back corner of the tavern. Without waiting for an invitation, she storms over and sits down opposite him. * 
 
 **SERA: ** Vidal. 
 **VIDAL: ** Sera. 
 **SERA: ** Let's cut to the chase, shall we? 
 
 *Vidal grins, causing his dark eyes to sparkle. * 
 
 **VIDAL: ** Why? Are you on a *deadline? * 
 **SERA: ** ( *Rolling her eyes* ) Yes, you're very clever. 
 **VIDAL: ** Oh, come on, Sera. You're *killing* me! 
 **SERA: ** Cut it out. 
 **VIDAL: ** Sounds like you have a *bone* to pick! 
 **SERA: ** Now you're just reaching. 
 
 *Vidal shrugs and takes a sip from a copper mug, the contents of which appear to be steaming. * 
 
 **VIDAL: ** So, what did you want... 
 **SERA: ** ( *Interrupting* ) Spare me. We both know why I'm here. 
 **VIDAL: ** Enlighten me. 
 **SERA: ** `` The brightest souls of Earth are being culled with far too much frequency.'' Does that sound familiar? 
 **VIDAL: ** It sounds a bit pretentious when you say it like that. 
 
 *Sera does her best to hide a scowl. * 
 
 **SERA: ** Will you take this seriously?! 
 **VIDAL: ** Oh, dear. Are we in for a *grave* discussion? 
 **SERA: ** Puns are literally the lowest form of humor, you know. 
 **VIDAL: ** Are you saying you do n't get them? 
 **SERA: ** I get them. 
 **VIDAL: ** Gotcha. Death just is n't funny. 
 
 *Vidal giggles to himself as he takes another sip of his drink. Sera looks on with seething fury. * 
 
 **SERA: ** You do know that it's not just my time you're wasting here, right? I want you to explain yourself. 
 **VIDAL: ** Oh, fine, whatever. Look, Sera, there's been far too much... well, of this. 
 
 *Vidal waves a hand, gesturing at the other denizens of the pub. * 
 
 **VIDAL: ** ( *CONT'D* ) There's supposed to be a certain balance to things. 
 **SERA: ** Who went and made you the supreme dictator of that balance? 
 **VIDAL: ** I like to think of it as a majority shareholder's decision. After all, without my work, yours would be pretty meaningless. 
 **SERA: ** Now who sounds pretentious? Anyway, enough stalling. Explain yourself. 
 
 *Vidal sighs and shakes his head. * 
 
 **VIDAL: ** Just look at the state of the world today. Did you know that we're scheduled to hit eight billion humans by 2024? 
 **SERA: ** Oh, we're expected to hit them, are we? 
 **VIDAL: ** Hey, nice! I did n't even intend that one! 
 **SERA: ** What's your point, Vidal? 
 **VIDAL: ** My point is that it's getting too crowded, and you're the one to blame. 
 
 *A moment of silence passes. * 
 
 **SERA: ** Sorry, would you care to explain that? 
 **VIDAL: ** Think about it. When a beloved celebrity dies, people go back and review their work. They share it with loved ones. It leads to feelings of closeness, which leads to *physical* closeness, if you take my meaning. 
 **SERA: ** Oh, right, *now* you decide to be subtle. 
 **VIDAL: ** Humans sad, humans go boink-boink. More humans! Better? 
 **SERA: ** And you think that's my fault. 
 **VIDAL: ** It is. Provably. Every person you take indirectly leads to thousands more being born... so ease up on the reaping a bit, will you? 
 
 *Sera contemplates this. * 
 
 **SERA: ** Well, like you said, it's getting too crowded. 
 **VIDAL: ** Yeah, but you do n't put out a fire by dumping gasoline on it. 
 **SERA: ** Fine. I'll ease up... and I suppose that leaves my evening free. 
 
 *Another copper mug appears on the table. Sera reaches out and takes it. * 
 
 **VIDAL: ** While we're on the subject, though... who's next? 
 **SERA: ** Suffice to say that he's been a recognizable voice for a while, even if he ca n't stand up for his ideas. 
 **VIDAL: ** Ugh. Why do you do that? 
 
 *A shy grin finally cracks Sera's face. * 
 
 **SERA: ** What can I say? I guess Death is a mystery. 
 
 FADE OUT.
",Rewrite the essay as a political debate between Life and Death,"**Life vs. Death**

In the smoky confines of a tavern, a supernatural being named Sera emerged from the shadows, her captivating beauty veiled by an aura of mystery. With her piercing eyes, she sought a man in black, her voice echoing through the establishment.

As she surveyed the patrons, a patron nervously raised his hand, hoping to catch her attention. To his dismay, Sera's scoff dismissed his offer, her eyes flashing with disdain. It was as if Death had visited the tavern, casting its shadow upon all who dwelled within its embrace.

The patron's fear was palpable as he rushed from the tavern, leaving behind the scent of cheap bear and the echoes of Sera's scorn. In the aftermath of his departure, Vida, a gaunt man with a mischievous grin, approached Sera.

""Now, that was n't very nice,"" he remarked, his voice dripping with honeyed sweetness. ""You could've at least given him a chance to apologize.""

Sera rolled her eyes, her patience worn thin. ""Cut it out, Vidal,"" she warned. ""I'm not in the mood for games.""

Vidal's smile widened, his eyes gleaming. ""Oh, come on, Sera. You're *killing* me!""

""Cut it out,"" Sera repeated, her voice firm. ""You're reaching.""

Vidal shrugged, his nonchalance unfazed. ""So, what did you want...,"" he inquired, his voice dripping.

""Spare me,"" Sera sighed. ""We both know why I'm here.""

Vidal's curiosity persisted. ""Enlighten me,"" he pleaded.

Sera's answer was swift and resolute. ""The brightest souls of Earth are being consumed by the darkness,"" she declared. ""It is a battle between Life and Death, and we are all players in the game.""

As the weight of her words settled upon the listener's heart, Sera's eyes bore into him, filled with a profound understanding of the interconnectedness of all living and dying things.",NrYoXgjHlB

 Somehow, Alphonse found himself more impressed by the towering mound of ancient bones and charred corpses than the beast that sat upon it. He wondered how many kings and queens and valiant warriors had found their end in that pile. 
 
 `` I'm much too young for that,'' the boy whispered. His neck was crained towards the roof of the cave. `` I come to speak vicariously.''

The dragon's fiery gaze pierced through the cavern's dimness, casting a menacing aura upon the youthful countenance of Alphonse. In that moment, the dragon's commanding presence overpowered the boy's small stature and youthful naivety. The dragon's words echoed through the cave: ""What do you want, oil-skin?

I wish there was some kind of disclaimer attached to my name that would make it forgivable if I said something stupid ( because in reality I'm the sort of person who hates being caught out like that ). It's defensive. I want to laugh it off and say'hey, stop taking everything I say so seriously, this is the internet, not a court room'. If someone does n't like what I have to say, they have every right to smugly reply'relevant username' or'of course an idiot would say that'. I brought it on myself deliberately. I do n't mind making it easier for people to dismiss me- I actually get into fewer pointless, circular debates this way. I deliberately discourage people on the internet from taking me seriously so that I do n't have far to fall if they try and knock me down. 
 
 I also rage-quit my last reddit account ( I miss my old username- it was a pretty cool Neil Gaiman reference ). The constant, arrogant bullying of some redditors just pissed me off. I'm no longer subscribed to most of the main subreddits, so I do n't encounter it on a large scale anymore. But when I decided to join up again, I chose a username that reflected the feeling that every single redditor was desperate to prove themselves more intelligent than every single other redditor. All the time, constantly. I encountered people on here who literally boasted about their own'intellect' ( stop using that word to talk about yourself, ugh ). I thought, fuck it, that makes me so angry that I will do the exact opposite. I will refer to myself as an idiot. I will be *aggressively* humble.

 King Thomas grabbed his sword. He'd taken the crown only ten years previously, but while a sword will get you a crown and a throne, only loyalty will keep you there. Loyalty of the Southern Lords was something Thomas never had, and those lords had seen the ease with which Thomas had taken the crown, and now they wanted it for themselves. 
 
 Thomas has tried all forms of diplomacy, he'd offered to marry any woman a great Southern Lord had offered him and they refused. He offered gold from the Royal bank and his messages went unanswered.

The enemy has broken the gate and made a wicked place.
The king has heard the news and grabbed his sword,
A sword will win a crown, but loyalty has more to afford.

In the south of the land, there's a tale to be told,
Of a king who fought hard and lost control.
Thomas the king, once on a throne,
Forged a battle to fight and lose the throne.

Diplomacy failed, gold poured upon the ground,
The Southern lords refuse to bend a crown to the ground.
The war has begun, the battle fiercely fought,
No strength of the enemy could withstand the king's wrath.

,"I was eight when I got lost here. 
 
 We were playing hide-and-seek, a game I was horrible at and a game I was determined to win at. As Sarah counted down and we all scurried away as fast as our feet could carry us. I ran to my dad's office. No one was allowed there, no one dared, no one would look for me there. 
 
 Before I knew it I was standing in front of the wooden door. The door I was never allowed past. The door my dad had forgotten to lock today. And it was at this point that I hesitated. I forced my hand to reach for the door knob and it was probably the slowest action I had ever taken. The cold metal against my skin surprised me so much I nearly pulled my hand away but at that moment something came over me. It was now or never. I tore open the door in I went. 
 
 The room was simple and yet, somehow, beautiful. A large wooden desk stretched along the far wall under a bay window with the curtains drawn. A lavish chair sat in front of it and the walls were lined with books from floor to ceiling in old dark shelving. I wanted to explore it all, I wanted to see what had always been hidden from me. 
 
 It was the'here I come' cry jerked me back into reality. I was here to hide, here to play a game, here to win. I looked over the room and wondered where a good spot would be and was immediately annoyed at how everything was in plain view. This would n't be easy. 
 
 It was then that I noticed one of the curtains hide something other than the just the windows. I rushed over, planning on squeezing behind them. I tore them aside and there stood a mirror. Disappointment spread through me as I realized I would n't fit. And my reflection echoed the anger that crossed my face. I noticed how silly I looked and laughed. Mimicing me it laughed, I raised my right hand to scratch my head and it raised it's right hand to do the same. 
 
 Then it smiled. And against my will I smiled too. 
 
 At that moment I noticed I could n't move. The boy in the mirror bowed at me and I bowed in turn. He said something, and my lips echoed,'Thank you.' The curtain dropped back in front of the mirror and everything went dark and I was all alone.

,"Yea, dead. Of course she was dead. Every time I get this close to finding that wretched Necromancer, he kills whatever lead I have. My hand shook as I stretched it towards that lifeless corpse. 
 
 `` Captain!'' a man cried from behind. My hand recoiled as I turned to witness the disturbance. A trio of armed warriors, their weapons gleaming in the moonlight as all eyes turned on me. 
 
 Thankfully enough, my cloak hid my appearance, but I knew that would n't last long. A gloved hand pulled my hood tighter as I stood, my other holding out in apology. 
 
 `` Listen, I know how this loo-'' I attempted, but they had none of it. I felt the impact of his weapon before I even saw his movement. Fierce loyalty, blinding speed. No wonder this so called `` Captain'' kept this one. I slumped forwards, I could feel that cold steel jutting out the back of my body. 
 
 I put a hand on his shoulder, raising my gaze to meet his. I admit, I always had a thrill at seeing their faces when they realized they had no priest in their party. The hallow sockets of where eyes should be, glared into the windows of his soul. 
 
 He leapt back with a cry of fear, his sword still sticking from my gut. The cloth, ripped from his death blow, billowed with the slight breeze, showing the dull white bone beneath it. 
 
 The other two men foolishly followed suit, years of hardened battle training would n't face up to the fear of fighting the undead it seemed. The other swung for my neck but it never hit it's mark. I winced as I leaned into his blow, catching it on my shoulder early and plunging the tip of my dagger up through his stomach. 
 
 I did n't want to kill him, honestly, but there was no way I would let him stand in the way of my goal. I was wasting enough time as it was. I coud n't waste anymore. My eyes burned bright green, my robes singed into smoke and I gripped the final attacking soldier. His cries of pain made my spine shudder as his flesh burned to the bone, and he slumped dead. 
 
 I held out my palm facing the last man, the first man who started the attack. He shook in the face of danger, but he still looked ready to fight. I kept my palm up, fire streaking between my bony finger tips and sending sprawling shadows into the night. 
 
 After a few seconds, an eternity of time in war, I lowered my palm and extinguished the flames. He ran. I did n't even get a chance to explain, I did n't get a chance to beg forgiveness for my sins. This would n't be rendered as an act of mercy, it would be portrayed as an act to spread my name. To warn every village from here to the Great River Styx of the Skeleton Sorcerer. 
 
 I slumped and turned my sights to the sky, the moon just barely sustaining the energy I needed to live, to move, to fight, to chase... I needed the warm glow of the sun once more. 
 
 It was n't my fault I was created, it was n't my fault I was n't given instruction, but that did n't mean I'd fall to the archtype of what these damn fleshbags always looked at us as. 
 
 Not all creatures of the night are evil.

Open your senses and pay attention to the sights, smells, sounds and touches that surround you. Notice the details of the city and the mountains. Take your time to observe the subtle changes in the environment as the evening progresses.

Joe, a resilient soul, brushed off his misfortune and pointed out the inconvenience of his broken door. The Dark Phantom, taken aback by Joe's composure, questioned whether he was truly a villain.

As purple mist swirled around his hands, Joe exuded a sense of calm and understanding. He invited the Dark Phantom to join him in a conversation, hoping to diffuse tensions. To his surprise, the Dark Phantom revealed his vulnerability and agreed to help fix the door.

 Frightened, he ran out of the house. A combination of smoke and ash tickled his nose in the foyer, and he sneezed, which resulted in more fire coming out of his mouth and landing on an entry table. 
 
 The fire department simply looked at him skeptically when he said he sneezed fire; they promised an investigation, though, when he modified his statement to describe the way that he woke up to find himself surrounded by fire, because that sounded like it happened to a normal person. 
 
 The next day, Nicholas shot fire from his wrists to make s'mores for himself and was successful. However, it began to rain. A thunderstorm quickly brewed over the park in which he stood and a bolt of lightning came straight for him. He cowered, and stood again in a shopping mall.

",Rewrite the essay into a formal debate with two sides,"## The Camp in the Canyon

The camp nestled deep within the narrow canyon exudes an atmosphere of both tranquility and danger. The canyon walls, adorned with years of water erosion, offer a stark backdrop to the unfolding scene. The few stubborn trees and shrubs clinging to the sides of the canyon are testament to the power of nature's forces.

With the current dry season upon them, the threat of flash floods is distant, yet the looming presence of bandits and raiders casts a much more immediate concern. Campfires burn here and there, their flames fueled by collected deadfall and the refuse generated by soldiers. The remnants of pallets, broken crates, and cardboard are abundant, providing ample fuel for the flames. The men surrounding the fires are well-dressed for the cool desert night, adorned in thick coats, long trousers, and knitted caps to cover their heads. None of them go unarmed. Tents are erected under the sheltering overhangs, camouflaged by netting to further conceal their presence.

Major Lucas Singleton Terry, seated with an untouched cup of coffee, finds solace amidst the rhythmic melody of the fiddle. The remnants of fried bannock and salt pork sit comfortably in his stomach. He roams through the camp, ensuring the watchmen are vigilant and prepared. The music finishes, and the men engage in various activities, stretching their legs or relieving themselves. The fiddle player strikes up another mournful tune, echoing through the canyon.

The contrasting perspectives on life and death permeate the narrative. The verses quoted evoke a sense of stoicism and resignation, emphasizing the transient nature of life and the inevitability of death. Major Terry's reflection on his own mortality underscores the universality of human vulnerability and the fleeting nature of worldly possessions. The overall tone of the essay is somber, yet laced with an undercurrent of resilience and acceptance.",kMDzaPNkvr
,"`` What do you mean, there's no more?'' 
 
 `` I'm sorry, Mr. Ganders, but your play has been rejected for publication. There are rea-'' 
 
 `` But I researched it, to your board's approval! The story was substantively unique. You *agreed* Mister Palesworth, you *yourself* signed the Clearance to Proceed. I have your approval-'' 
 
 Palesworth forstalled him with an upraised hand. 
 
 `` Our *provisional* approval, Mister Ganders. Look, I'm sorry but you're not the only one to receive this news, Mister Ganders. There are several hundred thousand fully licenced storymakers who are being told the same thing. Well, over the next few days.'' 
 
 Palesworth dropped his hand, sighed a note that rang only slightly false in Gander's ears. 
 
 `` It's a sad thing, Mr. Ganders, but it's true. All the stories have been told, and we own the rights to them. We've checked. Over and over again. Both statements are true. And after long discussions, the publishers have decided that as all possible stories have been told, there's no reason to have to tell them all over again, is there? I mean it would... think of how the shareholders would react! It would be a legally indefensible act to throw their money away like that. So we're letting you go.'' 
 
 Ganders, voice laced with wry disbelief said `` You're... you're firing me. From writing.'' 
 
 `` No no Mister Ganders, not at all. We just do n't... well we just do n't require your product any more. We've got them all. All of them. Again,'' Palesworth said with a slightly patient air, `` we checked. *Thoroughly*. Well I suppose you could change the names of the main characters or something but we have algorithms to do that. In fact it was the algorithms that told us we had them all. Funny thing, that. Yea. `` Palesworth smiled happily for a second before collecting himself. 
 
 `` So the long and short of it is we just do n't need you any more.'' 
 
 `` Because you own all the stories.'' Ganders said, absently. To Palesworth, it seemed that he was looking off into another dimension. It was unsettling. 
 
 `` In a nutshell yes, that's right,'' Palesworth said, clearing his throat loudly and putting on a patient air, `` but do n't think we're not just as surprised as you, oh no we're all still a little at sea over this. Several people have mentioned feeling queasy. I mean if it were n't for the spreadsheets I would n't believe it either.'' 
 
 `` Spreadsheets,'' Ganders repeated, a touch of heat rising in his cheeks. 
 
 `` Yes, spreadsheets. Frightfully complicated ones I'll admit but once you got a handle on how to read them it just sprang out at you. All possible permutations have been covered. Really. Japanese crocodile hunter in the tenth century?'' 
 
 Palesworth playacted searching a list on a clipboard, theatrically ticked an imaginary box while somehow looking simultaneously pleased for having come up with a random premise. 
 
 `` Yep, got it.'' Tick. `` In the fourth century? Five of'em.'' Tick tick tick tick tick. `` The sixth?'' Tick. `` How about prehistory?'' Tick. `` Or the future, or on another planet, or some medieval fantasyland, `` Palesworth mimed ticking boxes at a maniacal speed, `` or whatever, Mister Ganders. They're there.'' 
 
 Palesworth sat back heavily in his overstuffed chair, looking hard done by. 
 
 `` You're a researcher, you know how hard it's been for, what decades now to find new ones. Did n't you see it coming? I mean the writing was on the wall, was n't it Mister Ganders?'' 
 
 Palesoworth nestled a tad, a smug air threatening to condense around him. He waved his raised palms slowly outward, shrugging as he did. 
 
 `` What can we do? What can we do Mister Ganders but accept it and move on. They're done. *You're* done. It's sad to say but there it is. You can expect a handsome severance package in a couple of weeks. You've done particularly well by us Mister Ganders, four best sellers I think it was, was n't it. So yes, we'll do well by you.'' 
 
 Ganders smiled. `` You think owning them will shut people's mouths? Stop story-telling? We-'' 
 
 `` No, Mister Ganders, we expect to continue to make a lot of money suing people who tell those stories illegally. It's a not insignificant part of the plan. Now you scurry off to whatever it is you plan to do with the rest of your life. Not all lives end happily, Mister Ganders. Your lot taught us that.'' 
 
 The sounds of the shoes padding on thick carpet and the door closing softly was immensely pleasurable to Mr. Palesworth.

 `` That's right, officer.''

 `` I was at the bus stop on my way to work, waiting for the 3:25AM bus.'' 
 `` And what was your first indication that something unusual was happening?'' 
 `` I heard the word'PIKILTI!' shouted from nowhere -- no, *everywhere* -- as loud as a thunderclap.'' 
 ``'Pikilti'?''

 `` Mrs. Castillo stood up like she'd been hit with a taser. She's an old lady from Guatemala who rides the same bus every day, and she does *not* speak Lithuanian, so I do n't know why she stood up. Then there was an even *louder* sound like a horn blast, and it shattered every window I could see from the bus stop.'' 
 `` Yes... and then what?'' 
 `` The bus stop is at the corner of a big cemetery, and though my ears were still ringing, I heard a rumble from that direction. I looked and saw dirt and bodies flying up.'' 
 `` Was it... happening everywhere?'' 
 `` You know, it's funny that you would ask that. There was stuff flying up in isolated spots all over the place, but *the older sections* were so involved that it looked as though bombs were going off there. The dirt fell back toward the ground, but the bodies kept rising, head first, with their hands stretched up like flying cartoon superheroes.'' 
 `` Okay... and where did they go?'' 
 `` Well, there was a cloud layer that looked to be about five hundred feet up. It had a really bright glow, as if the sun were above it, even though this was hours before sunrise. It lit up everything. All the bodies kept rising until they disappeared into the cloud layer. Then I heard Mrs. Castillo shout something, and when I turned around she was rising into the air after them! She disappeared into the cloud layer a few seconds later along with a few others, and right after that the clouds disappeared and the sky was clear.'' 
 `` Do you know if Mrs. Castillo was involved in any... prohibited cult activities?'' 
 `` Wow, *that's* an odd question. Mrs. *Castillo*? I ca n't imagine her being involved with a *terrorist* group! No, I'm sure she was n't.'' 
 `` All right... Do you have anything else to add?'' 
 `` No, that's everything I saw. Do the authorities have any idea what could have caused it? Was it some weird kind of terrorist attack, like they're saying online?'' 
 `` I do n't think anyone's sure yet, but I know there several agencies working on it.'' 
 `` Do you think it was connected to the mass prison escapes they say happened the same night?'' 
 `` I ca n't confirm that, sir... Well, that's all for now. Thank you for your time, Mr. Kleiza.'' 
 `` Not at all, officer, I'm always happy to do what I can to help the police. If it were n't for you guys, this place would go straight to hell.''

",Rewrite the essay as a romance where Jesus is the protagonist and one of the lovers .,"In a celestial dance of grace and mystery, Jesus, the embodiment of love and redemption, descended from heaven on a day etched in the annals of time. With a voice as soft as the wind whisperings secrets through the trees, He commanded the dead to rise, their slumbering bodies stirring to life. The trumpet call of God echoed through the air, heralding the dawn of a new era.

As the trumpet resonated, a young man named Kleiza found himself immersed in a mundane bus stop encounter. The tranquility of the evening was shattered by the piercing sound of the trumpet, as if a thunderclap had ripped through the tranquility. A chorus of voices rose in unison, echoing the trumpet's call, and the old woman, Mrs. Castillo, stood up like a testament to the magnitude of the event.

With a mixture of awe and terror, Kleiza watched the dead rise from their graves. Their disembodied limbs danced in the air, their hands reaching out as if pleading for salvation. The cemetery became a battlefield of destruction, as the bodies surged forward, their movements mimicking the grace of dancers in a fiery dance.

As the earth trembled beneath their feet, Jesus's presence permeated the air, offering solace and redemption. His eyes met Kleiza's, and in that moment, the young man felt an overwhelming sense of awe and wonder. It was as if the embodiment of love and grace had spoken directly to him, promising a future filled with hope and salvation.

This concept could be summarized as a series of interactive webcomics, divided into several branching storylines:

**Starting point:** The protagonist, facing challenging terrain and a broken radio, struggles to climb a willow tree to reach a signal.

**Branching points:** 

1. **Focus on self-preservation:** After scrambling up the tree, the protagonist pauses to inspect her wounds, choosing to prioritize her safety and ignore the questions. This path leads to a different outcome than the other branch.
2. **Prioritize communication:** Despite her injuries, the protagonist quickly answers the radio, hoping to receive help and ignoring the precariousness of her position. This path leads to a different sequence of events and a potential climax.

,"For the first time, I saw the stars. 
 
 When I was a kid, I was told that once, the world was a warmer and better place, with the sun shining brightly in the day and the moon and the stars adorn the pitch black sky in the night. 
 
 Well, until the End with capital E happened, when idiots in suits that pretended to understand humanity took humanity down with them, annihilating majority of our population with a weapon no one ever conceived before and no one will ever conceive after. After that, there are no more light other than dull illumination powered by huge geothermal power stations every five blocks. For us, the sky is brown bedrock a hundred feet above our head.

The rest of us could only live in underground cities and slums, dreaming of someday we could reach the surface.

",Rewrite as a political satire,"The once celestial tapestry of stars that danced across the velvety night sky has been forever tarnished by the blight of human folly. The celestial tapestry once illuminated the earth with vibrant hues of gold, silver, and crimson, but now the sky blares with the dull glow of geothermal power stations. The stars that once whispered secrets of creation and destruction are now mocked by the deafening roar of our collective destruction.

In a world where the stench of human hubris hangs thick in the air, I found solace in a moment of cosmic contemplation. As I gazed at the stars that danced across the brown bedrock sky, I felt a profound sense of connection to the universe, despite the chasm that separates us from its vastness.

The stars are a beacon of hope, a testament to the enduring spirit of creation. They whisper tales of a time when the world was a more verdant and harmonious place, a time when humanity danced with the rhythm of the cosmos rather than waged war against it. But the stars also serve as a warning, a reminder that the forces of destruction can quickly consume even the most luminous of civilizations.

As I stood amidst my fellow inhabitants of the subterranean city, I felt a sense of shared vulnerability and despair. We are all prisoners of a dystopian reality, trapped in underground caverns, dreaming of a future that will never come. The stars are distant and elusive, but they offer us solace and inspiration, a glimpse of a better world that we can strive to create.

In this moment of cosmic communion, I felt a connection to the stars, to the universe, and to my own insignificance. The stars are beautiful, but they should not be this close to Earth. They are a force of creation and destruction, a testament to the interconnectedness of all things.

The stars are a gift, a blessing, but they also carry a warning. We must learn from the past and harness the power of creation to build a brighter future for ourselves and generations to come. The stars are a beacon of hope, and we must strive to reach them, even in the darkest of times.",tDlhvhEKio

 Although he seemed happy and relieved on the outside, what he could not hide from his mind was the panic that first overcame him as he heard the UN secretary general publicly supporting his idea 6 months ago. 
 It all had started with a stupid bet long ago. How addicted and reliant on a website can you make the general population of the world? His friends all told him it was impossible and humans were too smart. They would discover what he was up to and stop him. 
 He promised to prove them wrong. And today he did it. 
 Finally, all of mankind had a single platform to communicate and engage with each other. Governments would be run using the platform, elections would be held, taxes would be collected and salaries paid. It all seemed too unreal to be true. He had won the bet and completed the biggest social experiment in human history. And now it was in his hands to end it. Only one task was left: Delete it all. Every single bit of it. 
 
 Mark walked over to his MacBook, with a big sticker of their platform on the back of the screen. He logged in and accessed the console. 
 He typed “ run bet-completion ”, opening a simple screen showing a simple question: “ Do you really want to delete Facebook? Y/N ”. 
 He hesitated for a second. Could he really delete his life ’ s work, everything he had ever achieved? His finger hovered over the Y. He kept thinking and the expression on his face changed slightly. 
 Then his finger slowly began to move towards the N, pressing the letter, confirming his action with the Enter key. 
 A new prompt appeared on the computer: “ Deletion aborted, opening cheat menu. ” He couldn ’ t do it. The temptation of ultimate power was just too big. The cheat menu gave him access to everything on the platform. The faith of governments, corporations, even individual people, at the stroke of his finger. Each person on the planet under his control, he had achieved unquestioned world domination. He walked over to his window, which faced the garden that the company had created to keep their employees in sync with nature and thus productive. 
 
 Talking to himself, he proclaimed “ My people. All of them. ” 
 
 Slowly, a smile formed on his face and he started to laugh. His laughter grew bigger and louder by the second and it seemed it would never stop. 
 
 Outside his office, Sheryl was just about to leave for the celebration the company wanted to throw for the occasion, when she heard her boss ’ s laughter. It gave her shivers. She knew, something had changed and that nothing would be same from this day.
",Rewrite the essay as a children 's book,"In a land far, far away, there lived a young boy named Mark. Mark had a dream to unite the world. He believed that all people could be connected through a single platform.

One day, Mark had a great idea. He thought that if he could create a platform that connected everyone in the world, he could bring peace and happiness to all. He worked hard to develop his idea, and finally, he had finished.

Mark's platform was called ""The World Connect."" It was a place where people from all over the world could communicate and share their ideas. Governments would use The World Connect to run their countries, hold elections, collect taxes, and pay salaries.

Mark was proud of his accomplishment. He knew that The World Connect would change the world. People from all walks of life started using The World Connect, and it was a wonderful thing to see.

But Mark knew that his journey was not complete. He still had one task left to do. He had to delete all of the data from The World Connect. This was a difficult task, but Mark knew that it had to be done.

In the end, Mark was able to complete his dream. The World Connect was deleted and the world was once again a peaceful place.",PRDzenGcXf
,"Wisdom. Wisdom is coveted. It's treasured by all walks of life in all corners of the earth. It's the final stepping stone of humanity. We all strive to be wise, to look up at everything and just know what's going on and be happy about it. We all want that. Everyone wants that. 
 
 To be wise is to be content. To be content is to be accepting. To be accepting is to be open. That is wisdom. Openness is wisdom. So when a person so open to life, so accepting of people, so content of circumstance becomes wise, they become the pinnacle of human achievement. They become happy. 
 
 Usually, and this is my uninformed definition based on years of inexperience, wisdom comes with age. It comes with intense mistakes and valuable lessons. It comes with years of regret and decades of forgiveness. Wise people are old. 
 
 Think Uncle Iroh¹. Think Buddah, or Abraham Lincoln, the Dalai Lama, Helen Keller, and Benjamin Franklin. Think Josiah Bartlet². Those old people were/are wise. Those people became wise after years of hardships and living. They became wise the hard way. 
 
 Then there's me. I'm not calling myself wise. Far from it, I'm calling myself storied. I'm calling myself traveled, which I am. I've been a lot of wheres and done a lot of things. I've learned a great many lessons and met a great many people. I'm not wise, but I'm close. And I'm young. 
 
 31 years old, to be exact. I'm not *young* young, I know that. I'm not patronizing myself. I'm older than a lot of very smart people who've accomplished many things of which I ca n't nearly comprehend. I'm older than a lot of smart people, yes, but younger than a lot more wise people. To be a 23 year old genius is one thing. To possess absolute wisdom at 23 years old is another. I may be pushing it, but I've got good years ahead of me. 
 
 Here's the first thing to know about me: I'm good. I'm a good guy. I live by a moral code not unlike those wise people above. I do no ill will nor stand for ill will done to others. My empathy scale is off the charts. I'm super duper nice and love living life, which I've done, extensively. 
 
 Here's the second thing to know about me: I'm straight telepathic. I hear people's thoughts, I hear them clearly, and I hear them whenever I want. That's crazy. Yeah, that's really crazy and I know it and I do n't know why I have this gift. And I said gift. That's important. This is n't any sort of Sookie Stackhouse³ deal. I'm not overwhelmed with judgmental thoughts from mean strangers. I can turn it on and off whenever I want, just like that. It has n't always been this way, high school being a completely different story, but right now, as I am, I would n't give it up for anything. 
 
 Thing three: I'm a wanderer. That's less important. But straight out of Dion's mouth⁴, I roam around, around, around. So it should come as no surprise that I'm wandering groggily into some Canadian diner at nine in the morning with no thoughts on anything and no idea where I am. I'm smart, I'm almost wise, I'm telepathic, and I'm a wanderer. That's me. That's all there is to know. So without further ado, this is an experience I had not too long ago. 
 
 The wind howled softly on a stale mid-January morning. My dull gray boots rightfully squished under the pressure of each footstep, each trudge that pulled me closer and closer to nothing really important at all. I was cold, tired, or weary. Yeah, weary's more like it. I was a pitiful weary traveler that had a bright idea to take a shortcut through a lawn of snow on my way to a slightly hungry breakfast. So my pants were soaked, my feat were soaked, I arrived maybe ten seconds earlier than the sidewalk route would haven taken, and I was grumpy. 
 
 I pulled open the icy glass door without substance, walking across the homely-looking establishment's entrance sub the usual gravitas common to my daily adventures. This diner looked appetizing, seemed popular in this small Canadian town. There were n't too many people seated, of which I really could not care less, my affinity to conversation not then present. I Thoroughly wiped my feet on the sludge crusted feet-wiping mat and teetered to the bar. 
 
 The cook on hand slid a paper menu from two seats down and introduced himself, asking my drink preference before wiping down some mess I could not see on the other side of the counter. 
 
 `` Green tea, please,'' I requested after looking the items over. 
 
 I was n't expecting to see such an un-diner like option, but was pleasantly surprised. I'd been drinking way too much coffee. *Way* too much. I love green tea, but there is n't really a market in small town diners and pubs across rural pre-Rockies Canada. And I do n't much care for the black variety, so coffee it was, with a bunch of sugar and a bit of cream. It'd been maybe three weeks since my last nice hot cup of tea, and I was loving it. That simple drink was the optimistic tipping point for an almost miserable day. 
 
 `` Coming right up,'' the young man said and ventured to the right while I looked over the foodstuff. 
 
 So the fourth thing to know about me, and this is more important than the wanderer one, is that I almost never use my gift. I know, I said I loved it and would n't give it up for anything, but that does n't mean I take it for granted. I respect privacy, a lot, and do my best never to invade it. When I was young and angsty and dumb, so very dumb, I abused my power to a really bad extent. I'm a good guy, I said I was a good guy, but I have skeletons just like anybody else. Although I prefer not to dwell, things got ugly and I walked away set monetarily for life. I re-payed everything re-payable and gave generously to the unfortunate people I affected, but I walked away. I walked away and kept on walking. 
 
 And that's how those four things collided. I'm a good guy who did n't fully understand the gift of telepathy and ended up doing bad things. After those bad things were done, I had to go wander away to atone for stuff. As a result, I value my power to a hazardous degree. I'll still use it to help other people, sure, all the time, but pretty much never for my own personal gain. There's a line somewhere I prefer not to cross. 
 
 So, back to the story, the nice employee had served me some delicious tea and I was still undecided about my breakfast. The sausage and hash browns seemed good, but so did the chocolate chip pancakes. And the steak and eggs. Man, do I dig steak and eggs in the morning. I took another delightful sip of tea and asked for a fruit salad, because, well, I'm thirty one. I'm not wise yet, but I'd like to live long enough to someday get there. 
 
 I twiddled my thumbs while waiting for the guy to do whatever it was he does to make fruit salads. It probably involved chopping or something, or not. I had no idea if it was fresh or frozen, but whatever, I'd already resigned myself to eating a little healthier than usual. The twiddling went on for some two minutes before my food was delivered. I, with varied melancholy, dug in. It was sweet, a little savory, all around not too bad. I still craved steak and eggs, but it was n't too too bad. 
 
 As I took my third or fourth bite, I heard the front door slide open and felt a steady whisper of cold clawing at my then scarf-less neck. With a forkful of pineapple in my mouth, I very nosily turned around to investigate. 
 
 Now, in the Canadian destitution that is winter, one would n't expect to feel warm. One would n't really expect to find anything, but especially not warmth. It's so cold with so few things creating heat, the days short, the nights long, the season unbearable, that true warmth is nearly impossible to imagine. Comfort is one thing. Finding comfort next to a fire at 11 p.m. with its ever-mesmerizing glow plastered across all inches of a nice quaint living room is easy enough. Warmth, no. Warmth is harder to come by. But I felt warmth. At that specific moment and the lengthy moments that followed, I felt the warmth out of warmth. And it was warm. What I'm trying to say is, well, this poorly thought out description of an easily describable feeling, this shamble of a sentence, is my attempt at introducing a beautiful woman. 
 
 The diner's newcomer was a very beautiful woman that made me warm and took my breath away and all that good jazz. She shook the outside's hazards off her person and wiped her feet before walking over to the bar, sitting maybe three seats down from me and my manly disgrace of a breakfast. What was it? A fruit salad and green tea? No, I needed steak and eggs and a piping hot cup of joe, black as black. 
 
 I did n't reorder, however, because as much as I would have liked to somehow impress this swell gal with my unhealthily superior breakfast choices, I was quite enjoying the meal at hand. So I stopped not-so-discretely looking at her and went back to chewing fruit. She promptly ordered a coffee, greeting the cook kindly and making polite conversation as she inspected her paper menu. Eavesdropping as any sane person would do, I overheard a little bit of her story.

As the sun cast long shadows upon the metallic sidewalks, the inhabitants of the metropolis found themselves shrouded in fear. It was as if an invisible force was lurking in the shadows, casting a pall of apprehension over their hearts.

S, a young and spirited detective, had a knack for unraveling the most intricate mysteries. With a sardonic wit and a determined spirit, he had a reputation for bringing those responsible for terror to justice. However, this particular case presented him with a challenge that he had never faced before.

The mystery began with a series of eerie occurrences that had sent shivers down the spines of even the most seasoned veterans. Reports of masked figures terrorizing innocent civilians flooded the police station. The victims described chilling encounters with shadowy figures, their voices dripping with terror.

F, a seasoned investigator, recognized the patterns in the crimes and believed that the perpetrator was none other than old Mr. Johnson, a notorious serial killer. With meticulous determination, he gathered evidence and pieced together the events that led to Johnson's reign of terror.

As the truth unfolded, S and his team of investigators raced against time to apprehend Johnson. They knew that time was not on their side, as he had a history of striking fear into the hearts of his victims. With every moment that passed, the pressure mounted, and the likelihood of catching him dwindled.

,"There was a room in my childhood home no one was allowed to go inside. My father forbade. A dark wooden door at the end of a hallway in the second floor, resting by a golden lampshade on the wall that did n't work anymore. 
 
 When I was a young kid, one time, I woke up to thunder noises and I left my room to go to the bathroom. In the middle of the hallway, I stopped and I stared at the door. For no particular reason I can remember. It just caught my eye in a way it had n't before. 
 
 In that dead silence of some lost 90's night in Anywhere, Texas, I thought I heard a noise behind that door, and I was scared. A voice whispering from behind that secret door that my father used to tell me never, never to open up. A voice whispering in a language I could not understand. I step-by-stepped my way to the door so slowly, I remember, and I touched the knob and I twisted it. The voice, the whispering, it grew louder. My hand was shaking and before I had put more than a slight crack between door and doorframe, the whispering was like screaming to my child ears and I backed out, and I closed the door again. I went to the bathroom, peed, went back to bed and did n't think about that door anymore. 
 
 I thought I saw a light inside that room. Like eyes shinning in the dark. I never told anyone that. 
 
 In the morning I found my father hanged by the neck and blue in the face in the garage. 
 
 I'm telling you all this because I ca n't sleep. I'm telling you all this because I went over this equations once, twice, 
 three times already. 
 
 Nothing. No mistake. 
 
 I'm telling you this because, as I sit here and try very hard not to freak out, I'm staring at numbers that will 
 change the world. 
 
 Do n't ask me about the math. My father was a mathematician, too, and even he would n't understand, I suspect. 
 Do n't ask me about it. 
 
 What you need to know is this: I can tell what is going to happen to everything, since an hour ago. It's because of this numbers, and the way I understand them and the way I laid them out on this piece of paper, but even I ca n't really put my head around it. All I know is this: from the moment I solved the last equation on this here piece of paper, it was all clear. 
 
 Now I look at an object and I concentrate enough, I can tell what's going to happen to it and what has already 
 happened to it. I can see the history of something throughout the whole universe. Beginning, middle and end of 
 every atom, from the big bang to the cooling of the galaxies. Any object. 
 
 This banana on the table, it was once part of a sun in the Kepler system. Its atoms are going to split, after Pangaea 
 II, and then some of them are going to leave the planet after a pretty strong asteroid crash. Do n't ask me how I 
 know this. But I do. 
 
 My wristwatch? It was stardust in the Milky Way for billions of years, did you know? I can tell you exactly how long 
 and how far it traveled before it came to be part of a round big rock that was to become Earth, and from that, 
 how it turned into several different minerals and changed and changed and changed and now it's telling me it's 
 midnight and thirty five minutes, and I hear a knock on the door. 
 
 I'm trying really hard not to look in a mirror, is what I'm doing. 
 
 I get up and before I can even start walking, I hear the knock again. Louder. *It's going to wake up the kids*, I think, and, again, another loud knock. 
 
 I'm reminded of my father's secret door, and a cold night in Texas, as I slow step by slow step my way to my house's front door. The knock again. Loud. So loud against the shattering sound of rain outside. 
 
 *Who on Earth could it be? * I think. My eyes are fixed on the door as I reach it, and already I start to see distant suns and swirling stars and astral bodies. The story of that door. 
 
 I press my eyes together, flushing the image away from my mind. Not now. 
 
 `` Who is it?'' I say, to the door. 
 
 That whispering. Just like when I was a kid. 
 
 `` Who is it?'' Again, nothing. I touch the doorknob. *That loud and silent at once whispering*. Low and high pitched at the same time, like Gregorian singing. 
 
 I twist the doorknob and open the door at once and the sound of the rain and thunder fill my ear. No more whispering. 
 
 On the other side of the door is my father. My dead father, expect not. 
 
 `` We need to talk, Sam'', is what he says, before everything is black and I pass out. 
 

",Rewrite the essay to be a silly and whimsical modern fairytale,"In the land of twinkling stars and mischievous gnomes, there once lived a young maiden named Luna, whose childhood home was sprinkled with secrets and whispers of the past. One fateful night, as the moon cast its glow upon the quaint town of Anywhere, Texas, Luna found herself alone in her room, her mind wandering through the shadowy corridors of her home.

As she drifted deeper into slumber, a thunderous storm erupted, shattering the tranquility of the night. Suddenly, she awoke, her senses tingling with the anticipation of adventure. In the dim light of the hallway, her eyes rested upon a mysterious door, its ebony hue shrouded in mystery. It was a door that had been forbidden to her by her father, a man of wisdom and caution.

With a mix of fear and curiosity, Luna took a courageous step towards the door, her footsteps echoing through the hallway. As she approached, the door seemed to whisper secrets into her ear, a voice as soft as the wind rustling leaves. The whispers were in a language she could not understand, but they sent shivers down her spine and made her feel as if she was on the verge of unraveling a hidden mystery.

With trembling hands, Luna reached for the knob and twisted it. The whispers intensified, their tone rising like a storm cloud. Her hand shook, and before she had even managed to crack the door open wide, the voices erupted into a scream, filling the room. Fear consumed her, and she backed out quickly, her heart pounding with terror.

The door slammed shut behind her, and as she made her way to the bathroom, she felt a sense of relief that she had escaped the clutches of that ghostly realm. The memories of that night remained etched in her mind like a vivid dream.

In the morning, Luna found her father hanging lifeless in the garage, his face pale as a ghost's. It was a tragedy that forever changed her life, but she found solace in knowing that she had been spared from the horrors that had befallen her family.

,"**Sauron the Necromancer, Ruler of all Middle-Earth, ** rested his chin on his fist, and blew air threw his nose. It whistled through his mask; a high-pitched squeaking sound. 
 
 All around him the halls of *Industry*, of Progress for *Destruction's Sake*, rang empty. Torches flickered in their wall sockets, dancing flames laid low by the sigh of the wind. 
 
 Somewhere, a postern door creaked open. As metal screeched against stone, for a brief, quickening moment Sauron thought he heard the pitter-patter of small, harry, *Hobbit* feet. 
 
 Fiery images and sweet, distant screams, echoed through his mind - piles and piles of diminutive skeletons - and Sauron was reminded, once again, that the Glory Days were over. All he had left were memories, and an old, constantly whispering ring that seemed to be incapable of *shutting up*. 
 
 `` Master-'' Skreevil the Pretty scampered into his view, his ruddy snout split in two by some old battle. *How the orcs come up with these ridiculous names... * 
 
 `` Master, we've found him. The *last* of Man. We've gutted him clean and his skin was strung up to dry. This is the dawn of the age of the ORC!'' Skreevil slammed a fist to his chest, and uttered a whooping howl. 
 
 Sauron shrugged his mailed shoulders, not bothering to lift his head. 
 
 `` That's fine, Skreevil.'' 
 
 `` Master?'' Skreevil ducked and weaved in that pathetically timid way the smaller orcs do, as if Sauron might smash his tiny skull into pieces at any moment, `` Master, is something wrong?'' 
 
 `` Have you ever heard the song of the Valar, Skreevil?'' 
 
 `` Is that the one by Barbish the Blood-mouthed?'' 
 
 `` No, no,'' Sauron's wistful tones were low, monotonous, as if inflection itself was too difficult - or too pointless a task, `` It does not matter. It is not a song you will ever hear, because they are all dead. Just like the elves. And the hobbits. And the ents...'' 
 
 `` The dwarves,'' Skreevil sniveled helpfully. 
 
 `` Truly?'' Sauron was lifted briefly out of his stupor by a longing pang in his chest, `` When did they go?'' 
 
 `` Last century, my lord. You always said they'd end up killing themselves.'' 
 
 `` Pity. I should have liked-'' 
 
 A thought struck Sauron like an arrow through an eye-socket. Skreevil cocked his head at his master, fidgeting. When Sauron sat up in his throne, Skreevil automatically threw his hands in front of his face, and squealed. 
 
 Yet the smashing did not come. Skreevil uncovered his face. Sauron was staring down at him, twin kindlings of fire glowing behind his mask. Sauron had his left hand - the hand with the ring - cupped to his ear, and was nodding along as if someone was whispering to him. 
 
 At last, Sauron's voice broke the silence: 
 
 `` Skreevil, how would you like to be a general?'' 
 
 `` A general...'' slowly, a wicked grin spread over Skreevil's face - until a thunderbolt of confusion split his thoughts, `` But, my lord, what armies would I command? We are at peace!'' 
 
 `` For now, yes. That's exactly what we want *them* to think-'' Sauron stood at his full height. He put out his hands, and gripped Skreevil by his shoulders, until Skreevil winced in pain, `` That's why this is the perfect time to strike!'' 
 
 `` Strike- who- my lord-'' Skreevil tried to shrink away from Sauron's grip. 
 
 `` The *Goblins, * Skreevil. The *Trolls* and the *Ogres*. We'll slaughter every last one of them, and we'll- we'll-'' Sauron's hands disappeared from Skreevil's shoulders, and he turned around just in time to see Sauron collapse into his throne. A sigh rushed from behind the mask; a sound like a hundred swords being bent in half. 
 
 `` Oh, forget it. Forget the whole thing. It's this blasted *ring* - I made it in one night of teenage angst, and it's never stopped haunting me. Sometimes, I wish I had just let those poor little hobbits throw it into the fire.'' 
 
 *** 
 
 **'' But it has *worms* in it! `` ** Sauron the Mighty, the First and Last Emperor of Middle-Earth, was arguing with an Orc. Sauron wedged himself into the open door, so the orc could not see around Sauron's sizable frame. 
 
 Gorzog Stinkbreath, who unfortunately lived up to his name, was clever for an orc. That's why he was made Chef - anyone can kill, but it takes true talent to cook. At least, that's what he told himself... 
 
 `` Worms is good for you, my lord. Full of vitamins and juicy nutriments,'' Gorzog demonstrated his point by pulling a worm out of the wriggling, infested bread, and dropping it down his gullet. 
 
 Sauron, covered his nose with one hand and shuddered. 
 
 `` I do not want it,'' his voice was muffled by his armored fingers. 
 
 `` But-'' 
 
 `` Gorzog, I am *busy*. I do not *want* it. I am trying to - I am very busy. Leave me alone!'' Sauron slammed the door in Gorzog's face. The door, a massive, metal thing, with spikes at the top and the bottom, cracked against the stone frame so hard that one of its hinges broke. 
 
 The door swung itself open ( well, to be honest, Gorzog *might've* helped it swing open by kicking at the hinges a few times, but Orcs were rarely honest, so - *the door swung itself open* ). 
 
 Gorzog was assaulted with a barrage of awful, foul-smelling odors: baking apples and cinnamon, acrid-yet-pleasant pipe weeds, and were those... flowers? 
 
 Before he could stop himself, the question tumbled out of his mouth, `` My lord, what are you doing in-'' 
 
 `` Out!'' Sauron shrieked, his long cape fluttering behind him, `` Get out of my workshop, right now! Do n't you orcs ever *KNOCK?! *'' 
 
 But it was too late. Gorzog had seen. 
 
 `` Is those cups filled with ale?'' 
 
 `` *No. *'' 
 
 `` Yes, they is. And that's pipe weed, right? Why is there curly hairs all over the floor?'' 
 
 `` *It's not hair, it's- it's-'' 
 
 `` You're making Hobbits, is n't you!'' 
 
 There was a whiff of air, and the door slapped shut behind Gorzog. Sauron swept towards him, one accusing finger jutting out of a mailed fist - aimed directly at Gorzog's face. 
 
 `` Look, you-'' Sauron lowered his gaze to Gorzog, and started coughing ( *what on Middle-Earth has this Orc been eating? * ), `` You do n't spill a *word* of what you saw in here, Gorzog. Not a *word. *'' 
 
 `` But Master, we killed all the Hobbits. We torched their inns, and we buried them in their own holes. Why do you want to bring them back?'' 
 
 `` I do n't want to bring them back!'' Sauron snapped. He pressed his fingers to his temples, and sighed, `` I'm sorry. I did n't mean to yell at you Gorzog. It's the food, it's the music, it's- it's- oh, you would n't understand.'' 
 
 Inwardly, Gorzog agreed with that, but he valued his life. He looked at Lord Sauron, and for the first time he noticed the cotton sticking out of the ear-holes in Sauron's mask. 
 
 Noting Gorzog's gaze, Sauron plucked, almost guiltily, at the cotton, `` What? This? This was the only way I could get that damned ring out of my head. Kill this, destroy that, betray them - I'm sick of it! SICK.'' 
 
 `` Of course, my lord,'' Gorzog backed away. 
 
 Gorzog thought Sauron was right - he *was* sick, but it was the kind of sickness that made you worry. If an Orc was sick like this, well, the Medicine Orcs usually prescribed a brutal, painful death. *Gorzog had to tell someone. * 
 
 Sauron bent over his table, clutching at the weeds, and letting the Old Toby crumble through his mailed fist, `` I miss the grass, Gorzog. I miss the flowers, and the way the leaves sound when the wind rushes through them-'' 
 
 *Flowers? Next he'll be talking about forgiveness, and love, and other menfolk things. * 
 
 `` Uh huh,'' Gorzog nodded, humoring the Dark Lord as he slowly backed out of the room. 
 
 `` Have you ever heard the Song of the Valar, Gorzog? 
 
 Gorzog had one hand on the door. He had hoped to escape without the Master's notice. The question hung in the air, unanswered. 
 
 `` Gorzog...'' Sauron's voice was a deep, metallic growl, `` You're not leaving, are you?'' 
 
 `` Ah,'' he said, slowly. *Perhaps the Dark Lord had n't changed so much after all. * 
 
 Gorzog fumbled with the broken hinge, scrambling to pull open the might door. He planted his feet on the stone floor, and heaved and heaved and- 
 
 Sauron's mace crashed down on his skull with a ringing ***WHUNK***. 
 
 `` I could've had an army of Hobbits,'' the Ruler of Middle-Earth muttered to himself.

 ================================================ 
 
 Josa was like any other, rich tattoos covering his skin. Absently he scratched at one on the back of his hand. It reminded him of lightning - it's forked spikes reaching from wrist towards knuckles. He stopped his observations however as the master passed by and instead kept sweeping. As an orphan and an outcast he had no rights and thought himself lucky that he at least had a few meals a week. 
 
 It was funny really. Without the outcasts to sweep, mine and toil the citizens would have no crafts or livelihoods with which to placate the high class. And if *they* were not placated then they would skip the citizens and merely execute a few dozen outcasts. Surely if that continued then a time would come when there were no outcasts to toil, *then* who would they slaughter? Probably not the citizens, because it was n't *their* fault that the Gods had vanished three centuries ago. Oh no, that was the *outcasts*. Of course. 
 Josa kept his thoughts locked inside his own mind, to question a higher class was to be executed and he had no intention of following in his father's footsteps, or his mother's for that matter. 
 
 At thirteen or so Josa was too young to work the heavy machinery in the textile mill, but in a few years he would be under the master's whip. Thankfully Josa's fascination with his markings kept his mind from that most of the time. Everyone in Ladenel had markings. Inky black stains that formed patterns and shapes. Josa always thought his were different but it seemed everyone thought the same about their own. Other people's markings were just squiggles to him, but his own had a pattern. The one on his hand was like lightning, his arms contained quick lines like the hurried strokes of a high class painter - seemingly making no concrete shape and yet having a pattern to them all the same. Here and there flame-like shapes licked his skin, perfect, dark circles the size of small fruits dominated other areas and something shaped like the sun sat on his forehead. A pale circle surrounded by lines shining out from it. 
 He had spent countless nights sitting and staring at his marks by moonlight and still had no answers. Some of the high class scholars believed that they predicted the life events of the person. A few radicals thought they were events from a past life and setup whole libraries to catalog and study them hoping to work out who a person was in their previous life. Josa did n't believe either. It was n't that he thought they were *wrong* just that he did n't think they were particularly *right* either. Perhaps the lightning meant he would be struck one day - killed even. The sun on his forehead could be the God under which he was born. The circles? He had n't decided those yet, nor the lines and flames. 
 Shouts shocked Josa back to the real world. A commotion was brewing outside the mill. Men's voices shouting at each other. Josa glanced around and did n't see the master so he made his way towards the sounds at the far end of the mill, near a wide sliding door. It was shut but it was also very thin. Through he he could hear the voices more clearly. It was a fight of some kind. Not that unusual, but then the faint clinking of chainmail and drawing of swords. Josa slid the doors open a slither and peeked out. What he saw terrified him. 
 Three burly outcasts - marked by their ragged clothing and dirty skin - stood above a motionless guard. His vibrant cloak lying limp on the floor revealing his sparkling chain stained crimson. Two of the men held swords. One looked fine and ornate - the guard's most likely Josa thought - and the other was much more basic and less kept. The shouting had stopped and the three men regarded their equally numbered counterparts eagerly. 
 The guards wore their own rich, red and blue cloaks. Square looking hats adorned their heads and golden buttons accentuated both cloak and hat. Beneath the finery however was a soldier's garb. Chain mail and leather. A large sheath and a smaller knife pouch - after all, the outcasts vastly outnumbered the guard. 
 A flurry of activity began, slashing swords glinting golden sunlight, brilliant cloaks flapping with motion. A few cries, a scream, a thud and a clang of steel. Then the street was silent again. One man remained standing, four dead guards, two dead outcast and a lone, bloody figure standing above them all. Then the man dropped his fine sword and ran. Seconds later Josa heard the shouts and pounding feet of reinforcements drawn to the commotion but the man, the hero, was long gone. 
 What man would dare do such a thing? Josa was part awed and part terrified. He longed to stand up to the high class himself. Not five years ago they had killed his parents by execution for no crime. They were merely outcasts and therefore deserved no life. But despite his brave desires he was too small, too weak and too scared to do what that hero had just done. 
 The approaching guards checked the bodies for life and then began to search the area. One looked Josa's way and caught a glimpse before the boy dashed away. A moment later the doors were wrenched open by two of the guards. 
 Josa ran. But a half starved boy had no chance outrunning well fed and trained soldiers. The mill was big, and had rows of fast moving, spinning machinery, dangerous machinery. The perfect place to hide. Josa sprinted down an aisle between machines. Surprised workers ducked away then cowed as they saw the guard approaching. 
 Josa dashed left, rounding a huge loom and hoping it gave him the seconds he needed to dive under it's whirling mechanisms. He scrambled under spinning wheels and threading needles just as booted feet sprinted past. Josa breathed a sigh of relief and then panted heavily – the overwhelming sound above masking any noise he made. 
 Then the world was yanked away. No, he was yanked away. Pain erupted in his shoulders are gloved hands gripped tightly. He was forced to his feet and held there. He tried to spin to see his attacker but caught only a glimpse of a guard uniform. A dozen paces away a scrawny worker stood, looking guilty. Josa spat at him as the guards dragged him away.

#twist #rephrase #writingprompt #horror #positive #humor #fantasy #uspresidents #hero #heroine","Josa was born with constellations etched upon his skin, shifting and morphing with every achievement he unlocked through his hero(ine) journey. Unlike others, whose markings resembled fleeting squiggles, his danced with lightning and vibrant hues, mirroring the celestial tapestry above.

Growing up as an orphan in the oppressive town of Ladenel, Josa found solace in his unique gift. With each accomplishment, the constellations on his skin danced in harmony, revealing patterns that whispered secrets and aspirations. His fascination with his markings kept his mind from dwelling on the harsh realities of his life.

At the age of thirteen, Josa was too young to work in the textile mill, yet he dreamed of a brighter future. He knew that his constellations would guide him, leading him to greatness. As he grew older, his achievements began to multiply, and the constellations on his skin blossomed, transforming into intricate celestial maps.

Josa's constellations were not simply aesthetic; they held a profound connection to his hero(ine) journey. With each accomplishment, new stars emerged, illuminating the canvas of his skin. The constellations danced in rhythm with his triumphs, reflecting his aspirations and resilience.

Through Josa's hero(ine) journey, his constellations served as a testament to the transformative power of achievement. They were not merely markings on his skin but a reflection of his spirit, a beacon of hope for others, and a testament to the extraordinary things that can be accomplished through perseverance and determination.",HDGhhFIuVz

,"Their nation was a fantastical realm of romance and magic. 
 My nation was a incredible realm of industry and science. 
 
 Naturally, we were at war. 
 
 It is possible, that I was taking my dreams too seriously. But I felt offended, nay, *outraged* that somewhere in my subconscious I believed an elf could dare take on a battalion of gunmen and survive. 
 
 Preposterous! Foolishness! Idiocy! 
 
 We slaughtered them in their droves, and even captured their princess. 
 
 Who apparently was the reigining body. Who knew. She had long red hair, freckles all over, and for some reason would n't obey her master in the workhouses we put her to: shackled to a robot, of course. 
 
 I watched her progress with interest across my dreams. She seemed... Wrong. 
 
 Around her, beings would try to free her. Rats would come when she sang. Thankfully, we ensured the place was full of poison. 
 
 the very birds would try to fly her away, but we had many drones to shoot them down. 
 
 One day, she did n't do any work. 
 
 I had her flogged, naturally. 
 
 Eventually, her tears stopped, and she became harder. I was amazed, actually. 
 
 It's rare a Elfheim lass would survive. Most break down and allow the constant pressure of the iron around them to kill them. They do n't have the mettle to deal with our metal. They're creatures of flower and nettle, not flame and forge. 
 
 I grew sympathetic, viewing on my many monitors. I felt that her growing silence would pose a risk to my workers should she snap, so perhaps now would be time to provide the sprig of peace. 
 
 It was a red sky, as I strolled down the city streets, resplendent in my golden cape. 
 
 She was made to work in the spinning jennies, and so yelped as I dragged her out from under the cotton-smithing machine she was working on. 
 
 ``'ullo, girlie.'' I said, grinning at her. 
 
 I'm sure I was a bit terrifying. Most of the people in this sector of the workforce were former Elfheimers, so they still followed the basic courtesies of their land. Ettiquete. Like that matters when you've got a hot lathe to attend to. 
 
 She whimpered a little, before her face dawned precisely who I was. It helped that each drone bore a small resemblance to my signature headpiece, that every street had a large billboard of myself glaring down at the viewer. That my name was praised each night on pain of flogging by every member of my land. 
 
 I'm **BARON VON TYRANT**, DAMMIT! 
 
 I'm sure her thoughts went all over the place. Elfheimers are rather pathetic creatures, prone to flights of fancy. Perhaps she thought I wanted her as a concubine. Perhaps she believed I would free her, that her plight had softened my heart. 
 
 As if I cared. 
 
 I unbound her chains, then laughed as the robot drones chased her out the door, firing energy blasts as she fled. 
 
 Oh, she'd live. Maybe even find her way to this Resistance I've heard oh so much about. 
 
 They'll enjoy the little present hidden within her. 
 
 A small explosive device, that releases a small biotoxin. Most of her ribcage had it: it's why she struggled to breathe: the small red box pressed against her heart. 
 
 All it takes, is one discharge of magic... just one... and BOOM. 
 
 As I cackled, I woke up. 
 
 -- - 
 
 The coffee shop was n't too busy. I'd woken up early, so I figured I'd get myself a hot chocolate I could pretend was a coffee to my caffeine-addicted colleagues. 
 
 The ginger barista seemed a bit spooked at my presence, although she kept looking at my gut and smirking. 
 
 *Oi. I'm not that fat, damn wench! *. 
 
 I pushed aside the delusions of grandeur and took my coffee. 
 
 Huh. 
 
 She put her number on the receipt. 
 
 And a message... 
 
 `` Cheers, Tyrant, for the biotoxin. Our bomb-makers will find that most useful.'' 
 
 I turned around as I read this, back at the smirking girl behind the counter. 
 
 She'teeheeheehee'd at me before heading through the staff door. 
 
 I froze. 
 
 *What. * 
 
 As a fellow café customer pushed past me to collect his drink from the other barista, I remained frozen. 
 
 *What. * 
 
 -- - 
 
 That night, the Elfheim resistance went full swing. 
 
 Led by a princess with a magic-tainted/healed chest wound. 
 
 *Hmm. A worthy adversary. VERY WELL. In recognition of this somehow being a thing that is possible... LAUNCH THE COFFEE* 
 
 Great siege weapons launched glass cylinders containing boiling coffee on their troops. 
 
 You'd be surprised how quickly a unicorn made of sugar and rainbows will melt when confronted with hot liquid in a glass container. 
 
 It... quite frankly, smelled delicious. Such is war. 
 
 

",Rewrite the story through the eyes of a high school student who's forced to take an online class over the summer about the history of consciousness and dreams,"My summer break was supposed to be filled with fun and friends, but instead, I'm stuck in this online class about the history of consciousness and dreams. It's not exactly my cup of tea, but I guess I'm stuck with it for the next few weeks.

The class is called ""Dreamscape History,"" and it's taught by a professor who believes that dreams can be more than just figments of our imagination. He claims that dreams can be a window into our subconscious desires and fears, and that they can even be used to predict the future. I'm not sure I agree with him, but I'm willing to give him a chance.

The course material is fascinating. I've learned about the different stages of sleep and dreaming, and how dreams can be influenced by our waking experiences. I've also learned about the history of dream interpretation, and how people have used dreams to predict the future and gain insights into themselves.

But the most important thing I've learned is that dreams can be a powerful force for good. They can help us to connect with ourselves and with others. They can also help us to overcome our fears and challenges. I'm not going to say that I'm a dreamer, but I do believe that dreams can be a valuable tool for self-improvement.",PNxsQUtrcR
,"William ’ s third day in the desert had begun, and the moans of the undead had only grown louder. His mount continued to hobble over the endless dunes, breathing heavily with every step. The poor animal had marched across the desert without rest for days. Most horses would have collapsed by now, but the animal feared the undead as much as its rider. 
 
 When they reached the tallest dunes, William could look back and see them limping after him. Three days had passed, yet their pursuit continued. The piles of sand slowed them. They could not walk down the slopes without falling, and the steepest climbs slowed them to a crawl. But they continued all the same. 
 
 The Crusader had abandoned his armor after the first few hours in the desert. He had screamed and cursed when he dropped the scalding hot metal in the sand. If the undead had closed the distance, the armor would have been invaluable in combat. They could not chew through steel. William had not possessed the energy to curse when he ran out of food on the first day. He had tried to ration his supplies, but there was so little to begin with. His canteen had barely a sip remaining. He would save those last drops for the end. 
 
 By noon on the third day, his mount collapsed. He barely even felt himself hit the sand. He had slept in the saddle these last few days, and the rocking of the horse put him in a state of delirium. He rose to his feet and watched the dark figures stumbling over the sea of sand behind him. They were close. 
 
 The animal had served him well. He wished he could reward it by ending its misery. But the undead were attracted to live flesh. The Crusader stroked his horse ’ s neck, apologized, and continued the march. Two dunes had passed before he heard the animal cry out in agony. 
 
 The thought occurred to him that he should have brought a female horse. He may have been able to drink milk from a mare. He had heard of men in the east who mixed mare ’ s milk with horse blood to give them energy. Taking a male horse had been a mistake. He had made many mistakes in the week since the fall of Jerusalem. 
 
 By afternoon, he looked to the horizon and saw a wall of gray and yellow against the sky. He blinked the fatigue from his eyes and realized that a sand storm approached. If he were not so dehydrated, he might have cried. Behind him, the undead had only gotten closer. William ’ s aching legs had not carried him far. Somehow, he moved even slower than the horde behind him. 
 
 He reached for his canteen. There was no more need to save the last sip. When the drops hit his dry, cracked tongue, he let the canteen fall into the sand. With a weak grunt, he tore the sleeve from his tunic and wrapped it around his mouth to keep the sand out of his lungs. Dressed more feebly than any knight in history, William drew his sword and limped towards the damned. 
 
 The closest to him wore the same surcoat that William had once worn. It was red and gold; the colors of Richard the Lionheart. By the time the undead had closed the distance, the sand had begun to sting William ’ s face. 
 
 The surviving Crusader held his ground as his countryman staggered forward. The sun had almost peeled the skin from the walking corpse ’ s bones. One of his eyes was missing, and the other locked on William in a milky, empty stare. 
 
 William swung his sword through the man ’ s neck, decapitating him. He attempted to yell, `` St George'' as he attacked, but the cry caught in his cracked, sand-filled throat. 
 
 He swung again and again, striking down the bodies that shuffled toward him. Before long, the sound of the sandstorm had drowned out the moans of the undead. The dust blinded him. He staggered through the sand, swinging in wide arcs and striking little. He felt hands on him and he lamented the loss of his armor. 
 
 A moment later, the hands that held him flew away from him. Around him, he heard the pounding of hooves on sand and the twang of bowstrings. William ’ s adrenaline subsided, and he felt the ground rise to meet him. 
 
 By the time he regained consciousness, the storm had passed. He felt a horse beneath him. For a moment, he wondered if it had been a dream. Then, he realized that his hands were tied. Around him were the horse archers who had rescued him. His heart sank when he saw their tanned skin and strange armor. They might have been Bedouins, Saracens, Turks, but it did not matter. They were enemies, and he was their prisoner. 
 
 So William ’ s march through the desert continued. All that he had gained was a new horse, and a set of teethmarks on his forearm which he would keep secret.

,"Eighteen birthdays are exciting. It's the day when *everyone's* life changes because it's the day when everyone gets to know what they were born to do- whether it is fly, or fight. It's the day when each and every one of us are dragged off to a governmental quarantine facility `` for the safety of society''. They always come a week early to take us away. Do whatever they want to us. And throw us out again, alone in the world. 
 
 I like my life. I really do. Although some people rely on flying or telekinesis or whatever they do, I am fine non-superpowered. I do n't mind having to walk a mile to the library or actually writing to get my homework done. I like working hard. 
 
 I like being human. 
 
 And I've seen firsthand what powers can do. I've watched love ones being torn away, never to be seen again; good people who have lost the game of Russian Roulette that power selection is, who have had lives ruined because of bad luck. 
 
 It's coming up, my 18th birthday, the most important day of my life. And here I am-trapped in a glass cage, stared at like an animal in a zoo. And I am terrified because my life hinges on this moment. They may take me away, never to be seen again, because my power is'uncontrollable'- uncontrollable like my sister Tricia's allegedly was. She spent her whole life building up for... nothing, leaving a hollow gap in my heart and nightmares that it will happen to me. 
 
 I do n't want power. I want my life. I want to be home, celebrating with a nice cake and presents like it's always been done. Why ca n't life be like that? 
 
 I'm still in quarantine, where the seconds tick down to the time of my birth. They've provided me with a wristwatch which not only monitors my vital signs but also tells me how long I have left. Outside the cage, monitoring the data from the wristwatch, is a bored-looking government employee sitting at a computer. 
 
 My watch buzzes and I'm tense, because it's time. Panic rises in my chest and bile seems to sting my throat. 
 
 The woman has turned towards me and I look straight into her eyes, when suddenly words appear in my vision. I squint, making them out- *has affair behind the back of husband. Wants to quit governmental position and have children. Terribly insecure. * I blink several times as a voice I do n't recognize fills the air. And then I realize- I am narrating the words I see. And I ca n't stop it. 
 
 The woman jumps up and starts talking rapidly into a walkie-talkie as I bite my nails., trying to keep my mouth shut. I was a good secret-keeper. Before today. 
 
 I slap my hands over my mouth and try to avoid eye contact as a man- flanked by two armed soldiers- marches into the room, a false smile on his face. I try to look away but instead find myself looking straight into soft brown eyes. And suddenly I start shuddering as the words appear again. 
 
 *Highly ranked and trusted governmental agent, posing as a mere manager. Personal belief that only the'correct' superpowers- benign or passive ones- should be kept in a population has resulted in the death of thousands of `` uncontrollable/unfavourable'' people, including my sister- Tricia. *

,"John sat quietly inside the carriage. John had never been inside one of these horse-drawn things - in fact, it was unusual for him to be sitting down at all before nightfall. 
 
 As the carriage moved onward and the bumpy road jostled the carriage, John thought back to that morning, when he had awakened and began the day like any other. 
 
 John was a peasant, born to a lineage of peasants. Each morning he would rise, and it being the summertime, would follow his father and brothers out into the fields for another day of labor. 
 
 But today had been different - around noon, the carriage had drawn up, and a man dressed in fanciful clothing asked to speak with John's father. The men talked for several minutes, then the outsider gave John's father a small sack and motioned for John to come over. 
 
 The man was in service of the Crown and had chosen John for his size and strength. Of all his brothers, John was the tallest and could work the hardest. 
 
 John was to leave immediately to travel to the throne's seat and begin his service. John said goodbye to his family and got inside the carriage. 
 
 The carriage jerked sharply as it slipped a wheel into a rut, bringing John back into the current moment. 
 
 The man from earlier sat opposite John, staring out the window of the carriage. 
 
 `` It's fortunate we found a man such as yourself so quickly,'' the man said. 
 
 John was n't so able with words, and he preferred to be silent anyway. 
 
 The man continued, `` The Queen sent us out last night, she was so anxious to have this matter settled.'' 
 
 John looked down at his hands - leathery and cracked from years of hard labor. 
 
 `` With the unusual occurrences among the kingdom, it's no wonder she's anxious,'' the man said. 
 
 John looked out the window and saw a man working in a field suddenly collapse. John remained silent. 
 
 The man leaned over and latched the door to the carriage shut, then opened a small sliding door above his head and told the driver to double up speed. 
 
 A whip cracked, and the carriage jerked forward and then hurried its pace. 
 
 `` We're about to pass through one of the troubled spots, John, so keep your wits about you and wait for my orders.'' 
 
 John looked back out the window. John wished he'd just have stayed to tend the potatoes.
",Rewrite the essay with a sci-fi element; what if this took place on a space ship,"The spaceship hummed, its futuristic whine echoing through the cold expanse of space. John sat nestled in the plush confines of his cabin, gazing at the celestial tapestry unfolding before him. The velvety blackness of space mirrored the blank canvas of his mind, the cosmic tapestry mirroring the journey that lay ahead.

As the ship hurtled onward, jolting through the gravitational pull of distant planets, John's thoughts drifted back to that fateful morning when his life had been irrevocably altered. He remembered the day he had woken to the scent of burning incense and the promise of destiny.

John was born a peasant, a man of humble beginnings etched in the creases of his weathered face. Each day, he toiled tirelessly in the fields, his hands hardened like tools against the earth. But fate had a different script in mind for him, one filled with grandeur and purpose.

With the swiftness of a meteor, fate had chosen John for greatness. He was summoned to the throne room, where he met a man of boundless power and unwavering determination. The Queen, anxious about the unsettling events unfolding across the kingdom, had sent him on a mission to bring about peace.

John felt a profound sense of responsibility as he listened to the man's words. The burden of his destiny weighed heavily on his shoulders, and he knew that he had the power to influence the course of history.

As he stared out at the cosmic tapestry, John felt a connection to the vastness of the universe. The fleeting moment of his existence seemed insignificant against the backdrop of time and space. Yet, he knew that he was meant to do more than simply exist.

One day, as she skipped down the winding path home from school, cute little Emily stopped on the rustic cobblestone bridge that crossed a deep, but placid stream. In typical country style, there was a wall protecting the traveler from falling over. The rocky wall was rough and gray with a slight arch to it, but the keystone in the center was a smooth polished black stone. 
 
 Emily stooped down to pick up a loose rock from the bridge. She leaned over the edge of the bridge, and the innocent little girl stared at her reflection. The resemblance to her recently deceased father was striking, and she relished the sight of her father's eyes looking back into her own.

 But, before long, tears began flow and she cried out loud `` I miss you Daddy! Why did you have to die and leave me with HER!'' She threw the pebble into her mirror image. The ripples of waves distorted her face, and the once comforting image transformed into the face of her new, vindictive step mother. 
 
 `` Ha, ha, ha,'' the evil woman's picture seemed to cackle. `` Hurry home for your beatings! I have the hickory switch all ready for you!'' 
 
 `` I hate you!'' sweet little Emily bemoaned. `` I wish you would die! Die! Die! Die!'' Emily screamed at the imaginary voice. She began to weep louder, and shouted `` I want to see my daddy again!'' 
 
 `` What's with all the noise?'' a low, gruff voice responded. `` Ca n't I get a moments peace around here?' The voice seemed to come from beneath her feet. 
 
 `` Who's there?'' Emily gasped, glancing all around. `` Where are you?'' 
 
 `` Here,'' the little troll replied `` right behind you.'' 
 
 She spun around and looked down to see a curious looking creature. He was two feet tall, with wild sporadic hair spouting from various patches of his head and misshapen ears. His skin was rough and gray. It resembled the loose stone she had tossed into the stream. He had a crooked, yet friendly smile, which exposed his dirty, damaged, and oddly placed teeth. His beady red eyes were gazing right at her. They seemed to glisten like two fresh drops of blood on a stony surface. 
 
 `` Who.. What are you?'' Emily gasped as she wiped the sorrow from her eyes. 
 
 `` A friend,'' the little troll replied. `` One who might be beneficial, if you will benefit me.'' 
 
 `` What do you mean? How can I benefit you?'' questioned girl. 
 
 `` Well, I could not help but hear your cries. You seem to have a problem, perhaps I can help you? What evil can make such a sweet, pretty girl burst into tears?'' 
 
 `` It's my step mother. My father died hunting a wild boar to cook for my birthday celebration, and she blames me for his death! Each day when I come home from school she whips me for my punishment.'' 
 
 Emily turned around, and lifted up the back of her dress exposing the raw skin on the back of her upper thighs. Deep red marks crisscrossed against her legs, and crimson scabs were woven as from a loom. 
 
 `` These are not the worst. There are more in less noticeable places, `` she whimpered. `` If only my father was by my side, these beating would stop!'' 
 
 `` Well, perhaps I can help,'' cooed the troll. `` if you help me. You see, I am a rock troll, and I love to eat rocks. In fact this bridge is made of the most delicious form of granite in the land. I live beneath this bridge and gobble the pebbles that fall from above. Unfortunately, all the loose stones have already made their way below, and my meals have been very small lately. I dare not come up here to often, for most human would not hesitate to slice my head off if they see me. But, you, I feel I can trust.'' 
 
 `` How can I help you?'' the innocent girl inquired. 
 
 `` If each day, on your way home from school, you stop and throw a tasty rock down below, my strength will grow. When I am large enough, I will prevent your step mother from ever harming you again.'' 
 
 `` That's all I have to do?'' Emily gleamed. 
 
 `` Well, yes, in a way. You can help me gain my strength by increasing the amount of rocks you drop below each day. For each pebble I consume, so does my appetite for them. Multiple the rocks by three each day and recite this chant.'' 
 
 *Multiple each rock by three/ and my beatings will not be/ Offering these rocks to thee/ my sweet father I will see* 
 
 `` And if I do this every day, my father will be by my side? And my step-mother will no longer hurt me?' 
 
 `` I promise you,'' grinned the troll. 
 
 `` I shall see you tomorrow!'' the little girl beamed. 
 
 The next day on her way home from school, cute little Emily hopped and skipped her way to the bridge. Once on top she found three stones and tossed them over the side. She sang the chant as a lark sings to the morning sun. 
 
 *Multiple each rock by three/ and my beatings will not be/ Offering these rocks to thee/ my sweet father I will see* 
 
 She raced home that day, brave to face her whipping, knowing those beatings would soon be done for good. 
 
 The next day, as Emily stopped atop the bridge on her way home, she scoured the bridge for nine rocks, and set them in a pile. One by one she plunked them down and sang her joyful song. 
 
 *Multiple each rock by three/ and my beatings will not be/ Offering these rocks to thee/ my sweet father I will see* 
 
 `` I ca n't wait until that troll is big enough to teach my step-mom a lesson,'' Emily thought as she continued her stroll to her home. `` Maybe he will beat her with that hickory stick so hard that she ca n't walk anymore!'' 
 
 On day three of her ritual, she collected the twenty seven rocks into a large pile. They were getting more difficult to find, as she had already collected most of them lying around. As she pushed the pile into the water below, she once again sang her joyful tune. 
 
 *Multiple each rock by three/ and my beatings will not be/ Offering these rocks to thee/ my sweet father I will see* 
 
 On the fourth day, it took her almost an hour to collect the first eighty rocks. She placed them into a huge pile on the center of the bridge. She could not find any more loose rocks. As she searched the surrounding area, the smooth black stone in the center of the wall caught her eye. 
 
 `` I wonder if the troll would like to try this tasty black rock today. I will make his eighty-first stone a special treat!'' she thought. 
 
 She began to toss the large pile over the side of the bridge singing her little song. 
 
 *Multiple each rock by three/ and my beatings will not be/ Offering these rocks to thee/ my sweet father I will see* 
 
 After she sang the song multiple times, all the rocks were finally overboard. She walked to the shiny black rock, and jostled it loose from its position. She shouted below `` I have a special treat for you today!'' 
 
 Cute little Emily lifted the shiny, black rock from its position and attempted to throw it below, but before she could toss it over the railing, the bridge collapsed. The keystone was holding the whole bridge together. 
 
 Emily fell into the stream below, where the 10 foot tall troll caught her in his loving arms. 
 
 `` Thank you for all those tasty stones!'' he said to her. `` I am now strong and big enough to fulfill my side of the deal. Please, sing the chant one more time and my power will be complete. He lifted her high above his head as she sang one more time. 
 
 *Multiple each rock by three/ and my beatings will not be/ Offering these rocks to thee/ my sweet father I will see* 
 
 `` You will no longer be hurt by your mother, and your father will soon be by your side'', he smiled with his crooked grin. He slowly opened his mouth, and began to consume the sweet, innocent little girl.

One day, as she skipped down the winding path home from school, cute little Emily stopped on the rustic cobblestone bridge that crossed a deep, but placid stream. In typical country style, there was a wall protecting the traveler from falling over. The rocky wall was rough and gray with a slight arch to it, but the keystone in the center was a smooth polished black stone.

Emily stooped down to pick up a loose rock from the bridge. She leaned over the edge of the bridge, and the innocent little girl stared at her reflection.

Suddenly, a gust of wind swept through the village, carrying with it a rogue wave that crashed against the bridge. The wave carried with it a piece of the bridge, which landed squarely on the evil woman's head. The wave also carried away Emily's tears, leaving her dry as a bone.

The wind died down, and Emily stood up. She looked around, bewildered. The bridge was damaged, but she was safe. She had lost her father, but she had gained a guardian angel in the wind.",bTUrolOdou

 What happened yesterday? I remembered going to work, coming home, and eating dinner with my wife at Italiano for our anniversary. But after that? I strained to remember. Did we eat dessert? Come home? Have sex? My mind was completely blank. 
 
 Yes, I knew the government issued a code red warning about eating out. But it was our anniversary. We were n't going to submit to all this fear and hype about'The Infection' and break a ten-year-old tradition. 
 
 But maybe we made a mistake. 
 
 I rolled over. The sheet was smooth, unrumpled, and empty: my wife was n't in bed. My heart raced, and fear coursed through me. I *always* woke up earlier than she did. 
 
 I ran down the stairs. `` Maggie?'' I yelled, my voice echoing off the walls.

The air was thick with the scent of gasoline and foreboding, a harbinger of the storm that had swept upon our home like a hurricane.

I had disregarded the government's warning, heedless of the potential consequences, determined to uphold our tradition of celebrating our anniversary at Italiano. But the gods of fate had twisted the knife of destiny against me, shattering my illusion of a night steeped in joy and tranquility.

,"I unsteadily stepped off the ramp leading down from the lander and, prompting open the visor that shielded my face, breathed in deeply. 
 
 `` So,'' I said to no one in particular. `` This is what Earth smells like.'' 
 
 It was just like Jarrod had told me: all the sample nature smells from the registry onboard the station filled my nostrils, but all with an explicable added dimension. The soft waft of wildflowers, the sharp scent of pine; even the warmth of the sun seemed to be stimulating my olfactory receptors. 
 
 `` Ridiculous,'' I said aloud. `` Do n't pretend to be poet.'' But I smiled despite myself. 
 
 I consulted the Nav-unit on my wrist to confirm coordinates with homebase: somewhere in the vicinity of a large forest range, located in a land once called *Germany*. I briefly wondered if that was pronounced with a hard or soft G sound. Hearing a shout, I turned around. The visor quickly shut over face and numbers flashed across my HUD. 
 
 A man stood in the same meadow, followed by several strange animals that looked vaguely like clouds. He held out a rod or staff, shaking it in my direction, but my attention was riveted by the waist-length mass of grey hair that sprouted from his wizened face. Amazing! They never let people grow facial hair so long back at the station; there were strict laws against it. His leg was also interesting; as the miniature MRI did a flash-scan, I realized that the tibia was improperly healed from some past fracture, leading to the slight limp I could see. If I could get a nanobot booster shot to his leg, I could help him... suddenly, it dawned on me that he was speaking. And that I had no idea what he was saying. 
 
 I let him prattle on for a bit longer, and then lifted a hand to my temple. A small click registered the capacitance signature between the tiny maze of wires within the gloved fingertip and the receiver-relay machinery in my helmet casing. `` Come in, Marco.'' 
 
 `` We hear you, Polo. What's the situation?'' 
 
 I turned on the video feed. `` This guy seems to be a native - no idea what he's saying, though.'' The man was still spouting gibberish at me. His animals, identified in my vision as `` SHEEP'', milled about him, blissfully chewing grass. 
 
 A pause as the other line consulted with someone. `` Confirmed: he is speaking a derived form of German. Perhaps attempt communication?'' 
 
 I shook my head, despite the fact that they could n't see me doing that. `` Do n't think that would help; it would be like speaking ancient Anglo-Saxon with you. His Post-German is too different, I think, from the original.'' 
 
 `` Sit tight, Polo, we'll work on a solution. Over.'' 
 
 I decided that, despite my own words, to try talking to him anyway. After lifting my arms slowly to indicate my lack of weapons, I lifted my helmet off and brought my cowl down. A lovely, warm wind blew over my shaved head and I closed my eyes for a second, enjoying it. Then, I smiled and addressed the man in a form of German that probably has not been spoken outside of the station in hundreds of years: `` Hello, I mean no harm. Do you understand me, sir?'' I kept the formal tone, just in case. Manners cost nothing, as the old adage kept. 
 
 He looked at me suspiciously and answered me with something I did n't understand. But then, a small realization hit me; i spoke again, this time muddling some of my words with French roots and conjugations: `` How about now, is this better? Do you understand me now? I bet you do n't, but it should be a little more familiar now, I hope.'' 
 
 His eyes widened and he said something again. I still did n't comprehend, but I could hear the French basis to some of his words. 
 
 `` Come in, Polo.'' The faint voice came from the helmet and I hastily put it back on. 
 
 `` Go on, Marco.'' 
 
 `` According to the linguistics department, his language seems to be not only derived from German, but also --'' 
 
 `` French?'' 
 
 A pause. `` Indeed. How did you know?'' 
 
 I grinned. `` Never mind, Marco. My apologies for interrupting. Go on.'' 
 
 `` A linguist is going to come on-line and assist you with language acquisition. Additionally, we've been monitoring the conditions reported from your suit. Things look good down there.'' 
 
 `` Yeah!'' I said enthusiastically. Quickly amending my voice to be more professional, I said: `` I mean, yes. Radiation levels are impressively low, and the land seems to be fertile again - here, anyway. Just like what Jarrod reported from, uh, Venezuela, right?'' 
 
 `` Correct. We are creating orders to send Rangers down to other parts of Earth soon, to do increased assessment. Anyway, recommended course of action for you: attempt communication again, find out more about how he and his presumed community lives - tech, health, ecosystem, the works.'' 
 
 `` Will do, Marco.'' 
 
 `` Linguist Kala will be on shortly. Good luck, Ranger. Over.'' 
 
 `` Thanks. Over.'' 
 
 I freed my head once more and smiled broadly at the man. He looked at me, puzzled for a moment, and then slowly spread his lips into a toothy grin. 
 
 `` I think it's finally time to come back home,'' I said, beaming.

,"I always figured it was some form of synesthesia; above everybody, a translucent number, hovering above their head like a static hummingbird. I figured out soon enough that I was unique in this, that no-one else could see these bizarre numbers, a halo of creation and devastation. The nerdy kids on the late-night subway, a meek green 1. A young man down a side alley, gaunt and skinny, came in as a jaundiced 4. My reflection told me 6, blazing above my head like a personal sunset, caused by nothing other than a short fuse, as it flashed and fizzled in the mirror. 
 
 You got used to seeing anything between 1-5, and this covered the majority of the population. A suburban train line gave you 3's and 2's galore, a 7 occasionally popping up in the busier stations, but you soon got into the habit of not boarding with them. It was weird, seeing anything above 7. It did n't happen often, and I only ever saw an 8 once, and that was a gray sludge painted above Hitler's animated body, mouth rapidly spewing sludge for yet another propaganda film. 
 
 He changed that. He removed the blindfold, and showed me what the numbers meant. I sat in class, a cold autumn day covered the old concrete of the yard with a crystalline frost, refracting the light in a glorious beam across the side of the school's main building. I gazed out the window, daydreaming as the doddering, old teacher explained the basics of trigonometry in a droning tone, the scrawly tone drilling itself into your head, when suddenly i saw the flair out of the corner of my eye. A crimson supernova, radiating blood in waves around it, embossing the double numbers above the man below. 
 
 10. 
 
 To even think, the idea of a man worse than Hitler himself? My heart exploded into action, pumping waves of horror across my body, hyperventilation kicking into overdrive and leaving me ragged. And yet, *how could it be? * 
 
 He was pushed into sight, a big silver frame rolled around the corner of the yard, hands grasping the slender handles protruding out of the frame of the chair. Big, metallic spokes reflected the demonic color onto the ground, blood washing over the ice and turning it into a twisted battlefield. The drool cascaded slowly out of the corner of his mouth, dripping onto his crisp blazer as the assistant ferried him across the large expanse. She barely registered in the storm surrounding her, but a faint, calm 1 splayed it's lime tinge amongst the pyroclastic flow meandering around it. 
 
 Hairs turned to rock as I stared at this monster, this gargantuan evil, yet all I saw was a broken boy, too simple to even function, wheeled around like a trophy. I wondered, *how could THIS be evil? * 
 
 And as his deformed body shifted, and the void of his pupils hit mine, i understood. Rage incarnate spewed venomously out of the side of his cornea, and a word rumbled across my cranium like a tectonic quake: 
 
 **SLAUGHTER** 
 
 My mind splintered, and as the chunks transcended reality, the red glow stopped.

Above each person's head, like a beacon of power and peril, danced a translucent number, a testament to their strength and vulnerability. I recognized that I had a unique gift, a synesthesia of sorts, the ability to see these bizarre numbers, a halo of creation and devastation.

The nerdy kids on the late-night subway, clad in their meek green 1s, and the gaunt young man down a side alley, shrouded in a jaundiced 4, became my daily companions. My reflection illuminated me with a blazing 6, a personal sunset brought about by my short fuse and fleeting temper. It was as if the numbers mirrored my own fiery spirit, reflecting the strength and destruction that lay within me.

As I grew older, I became accustomed to seeing numbers between 1 and 5, the majority of the population's range. But the sight of anything above 7 sent shivers down my spine. It was like encountering a force of nature, a cosmic anomaly that defied explanation. The only time I ever witnessed an 8 was above Hitler's animated body, his mouth spewing sludge for yet another propaganda film. It was a chilling reminder of the horrors that could occur when power unchecked.

,"Nothing started off Stan's day better than Joey screaming `` Drainex! Better and fresher with an ALL-NEW rose mahogany compound scent! Never before has cleaning-'' 
 
 `` Joey, shut up for once. I get it, I'll feed you,'' Stan said as he rubbed his sleepy eyes and got out of bed. He walked to the kitchen of his small studio apartment, all the while the Angoran tabby kept yelling about the latest rose-mahogany-compound-scented caustic cleaner. 
 
 Stan cursed the monopolized chip in Joey's spinal cord. The fortune that it had cost to ensure that Joey would live forever was not only evident in Stan's savings account, but in Stan's mind - that it was selfish of him to deny Joey death. It had come at the cost of eternal torment for either cat food or cleaning fluid. 
 
 But Joey was Joey. Joey was a cat with above-average intelligence, but his lifespan was n't the only thing that was extended. 
 
 `` Joey. Joey. Come here to papa,'' Stan cooed at the cat. 
 
 Instead of meowing, Joey let out a series of digitized meowing sounds. 
 
 `` MeowMunch! Purr-fect for your pet, with extra-'' 
 
 The morning was the worst part of the day for Stan. For Joey was hungry, and he let his concerns be known to Stan very quickly. 
 
 As Stan scratched behind Joey's ear, the angoran tabby changed his MeowMunch tirade into a soft purring. 
 
 `` Oh! What a mess! Help us, Señor Lavador! Why, it's the one and ONLY Señor Lavador, with his-'' Joey's purring softly broke the silence of morning. 
 
 Stan stopped, and walked over to the pantry. He took out the MeowMunch bag and poured a handful into Joey's bowl, all the while Joey softly purred about Señor Lavador's preternatural cleaning capabilities. 
 
 # Joey 
 
 Strange sounds emanated from his throat, but he did n't care. So long as he got his food, he was okay. 
 
 But he felt strange. He felt long. Old. But he was as robust and powerful as the day he was given a painful sting in the back. Sometimes it itched, but when he tried to scratch his back, it was gone. So this bothersome thing was a bare irritant of little issue. 
 
 This creature that fed him was strange. Had different fur every day, and went somewhere for some time. It changed it's fur once more and left the world once more. 
 
 He tried to say something that was n't of his own voice when the creature was gone. Something that was n't of the strange replacement for his voice. Something that the creature was called by other creatures when they met. 
 
 He looked in the thing that made other things there but he could n't touch those things. Instantly, a creature like him appeared. Where he looked at the creature, the creature looked back at the same spot on him. When he swatted at this stranger, their paws met. Separated by something invisible. Something strange. And thus, he slowly, over days, came to a realization. He had all the time in the world to figure out who this was. 
 
 It was him. It only made sense that this stranger was him, but different. It looked opposite to him. It felt different. There was no warmth. Only cold coming from this doppelgänger. 
 
 # - 
 
 `` Saaa,'' Joey hissed in his effort while looking at himself in the mirror. Joey was a cat. He could only hiss and scream and meow, and his chip let out advertisements for candy bars and cars and other things. 
 
 # Joey 
 
 `` Saaayiy,'' he hissed at himself. It was close. Perhaps the fur-changing creature would like his efforts. The sounds he made were strange, but the creature recognized them to have meaning. So he would have to make such sounds to the creature. He needed to voice his major concern. A tragedy in the long term, something that he could not allow. His only hope, his only effort that he could make to make sure that the creature understood him and his concern. 
 
 His concern was that there was not enough food in his bowl.
",Rewrite the essay as a detective mystery,"The mystery unfolded in the quaint studio apartment of Stan, a man whose life was intertwined with the enigmatic feline, Joey. As the sun peeked through the curtains, casting long shadows across the worn floor, a sinister scent filled the air, emanating from the kitchen. It was the unmistakable fragrance of the rose- mahogany-compound-scented caustic cleaner, a scent that had become synonymous with Stan's morning routine.

But this day, something was amiss. The tranquil symphony of morning had been shattered by a series of unsettling meows and a chorus of complaints from Joey, a feline with an uncanny ability to express himself in an obnoxious manner. As Stan rubbed his sleepy eyes and stumbled out of bed, he couldn't help but be annoyed by the cacophony emanating from his beloved companion.

It was a mystery that demanded investigation. The monopolized chip that had extended Joey's lifespan had come at a hefty cost – eternal torment for either cat food or cleaning fluid. Stan had wrestled with the guilt of denying his friend death, but he knew that Joey was a creature of habit and would find solace in his meticulously curated pantry.

When he entered the kitchen, a scene unfolded before his eyes that made his heart sink. Joey, his once pristine coat ruffled and his eyes glazed, was ravenously devouring a handful of MeowMunch. The air was thick with the pungent scent of the food and the cat's purrs.

As Stan scratched behind Joey's ear, the angoran tabby shifted his MeowMunch tirade into a soft purring. It was as if he had solved the mystery, and the world was right once more.

The mystery of Stan's morning had been unraveled. With each purr and meow, Joey's spirit danced through the kitchen, a testament to the enduring bond between man and his beloved companion.",sQAjFRDUDQ

But eventually, as the visions grew more frequent and uncontrollable, the gift became a curse. After I could no longer remember the day of my wedding, Seeing had spiraled out of control. It appeared during mundane activities, as I showered, cooked or drove. It infiltrated my conversations, disrupting even the simplest of interactions.

The melody changes to a buoyant, rhythmic hum interrupted by sharp, repetitive clicks. A distorted vocal sample emerges, echoing the clicking and singing along to the hum. A blink and a sigh again. The vocal sample fades, leaving only the clicks and the humming.

It was a mundane transaction, one that I repeated daily, yet this particular day presented an encounter that would alter the course of my life.

It was a crumpled piece of parchment, the ink faded with time, but the handwriting was unmistakable. It was a cryptic message, filled with strange words and phrases that I couldn't decipher.

The cashier's eyes met mine as I wheeled my cart out of the store. She was young, with a vibrant smile and a mischievous glint in her eyes. As she winked, I felt a sudden connection to her. It was as if she knew I was destined to find the meaning of the cryptic message and that she was the key to unlocking its secrets.

I hurried to my apartment, my mind racing. I frantically searched for the message, my hands scouring the pages of my apartment.

It did n't move in the wind, mainly because the wind here is hardly anything, but it did have a distinct etching on the front. The old hammer and sickle. That's wild. The wall fell when I was six, and then we had a man on the moon same year. When did they get time to send a ship all the way out here? I do n't know but we hear back tomorrow what we are to do about it, or if we should just leave it. 
 
 DAY 31, Mars Base Dragon: 
 
 They wanted us to go retrieve it today, and do some scans of the area. And, I know it was wild yesterday but this is where it gets wilder, we found a whole base! An abandoned base. I mean, we know of it's existence but we have n't gotten a chance to go in yet.

**The Third Day of Mars Base Dragon**

We, the undersigned, have discovered a testament to the folly and hubris of mankind upon the ochre sands of Mars. This relic of the Crimson Bear's reign, a pathetic flag of the Soviet Union, stands stark against the barren backdrop of our celestial canvas. Its metallic tenacity defied the wind that whispers tales of an alien cosmos, but its etchings of the hammer and sickle sing a song of a lost era.

Our discovery comes at a time of bewildering cosmic revelations. The fall of the wall recounted beside the landing of a man upon the moon happened on the same fateful year, a testament to the boundless ambition of our species. The timeline of these events strains credulity, yet the evidence stands as a testament to our fleeting dominance upon the grand stage of creation.

The question of the flag's purpose and the existence of the enigmatic base loom large in our minds. What",

,"There's a mirror in the mines and as all mirrors do, it reflects what is in front of it. A woman stood in front of it, and saw her soul. But others only saw her beauty. Her beauty is the kind of beauty that make men lust after her, and other women hate her and therefore creates a kind of evil only beautiful people can inspire. 
 
 She did not understand why people surrounding her do such mean, cruel things. And why men would stare lecherously and try to touch her. One day, an ugly woman named Jay says'Let me save you' and she was delighted to be saved from the misery of this life, the way of man. She was lead to the mines and this time, the mirror showed what she appeared to others. Once she saw her beauty, all her goodness and kindness were extinguished. She felt vain, wanted and powerful. She knows why men want her and women hate her ( even her dad and her mom ). She was awakened sexually. Once she was disenchanted, she became human with the human failings she so despised. Jay said'beauty and good are opposites'. The mine collapsed and they both died, for only then she was saved. Jay had protected the beautiful woman from the knowledge of her beauty and sexuality because once upon a time Jay was this goddess who enthralled all, until she was blessed by the mirror of truth. After the blessing, Jay slowly learned what beauty means and longed to saved anyone from it because the curse of beauty is more terrible than anything she has ever known.

It is a mirror that mercilessly unmasks the soul, revealing its deepest secrets and vulnerabilities. It is within this sinister mirror that a woman stands, her beauty captivating yet menacing.

Her beauty, a siren song of intoxicating allure and cruel deception, has the power to ensnare men and women alike. It is a beauty that ignites lust and breeds hate, a poison that seeps through the veins of those who dare to behold its radiance. Yet, she stands oblivious to the havoc it wreaks upon her unsuspecting victims.

An ugly woman named Jay, a guardian against the treacherous allure of beauty, offers her salvation. With a single phrase, she utters, ""Let me save you,"" her voice dripping with compassion and determination. The woman, desperate for respite from the torment of her existence, accepts Jay's offer. She finds solace in the mines, where the mirror reveals the grotesque reality of her beauty.

The mirror's reflection reveals her vanity, her power, and her vulnerability. It is a mirror that strips away her goodness, leaving only a shell of self-destruction and despair. The woman is awakened sexually, but her awakening is short-lived. Dischantment sets in, and she becomes human, flawed and imperfect.

In the end, the mine collapses, taking her with it. Yet, her sacrifice is not in vain. Jay, the goddess who once enthralled all, has learned the true meaning of beauty. She understands that beauty and goodness are polar opposites, and she longs to save anyone from the curse of beauty.

She went to the principal and talked to her classmates. It was not easy, but Lily was not afraid. She stood her ground, and the rumors stopped.

The story of Lily's bravery is an inspiration to all children. It shows that bravery can be found in unexpected places. No matter what challenges you face, you can always find the strength to overcome them.",WdavcEVKRO
,"It all started last summer. My wife, Julie, and I had been talking for some time about getting a dog for the family. Our three boys, now in their mid teens, were finally old enough to handle the responsibility. My sister, Sue, and her two boys moving in with us a few months earlier following her divorce certainly complicated our lives, but it would do us good, we thought. We talked and talked about it, and made the decision. The first day with the dog, he tracked mud all over the living room carpet, spilled wine on the couch, and ran out the front door. I spent all night driving through the neighborhood trying to find him. The next morning, I wake up—and I swear to God, it ’ s like a dream. I can ’ t remember how I got home, but there ’ s the damn dog, asleep on the bed. And the living room is spotless. It ’ s like it never happened. Jules and Sue act like everything ’ s normal. Eventually I guess I sorta forgot about it. Blamed it on being tired. Put it out of my mind. 
 
 In November I crashed my car into a mailbox. A boy had run right out in front of the car, and I swerved to miss him. The car was fine, just a small dent, but the mailbox was ruined ( as it turns out, the house belonged to my ex-girlfriend from high school, Rebecca ). With everything that happened that day—my wife got jealous, and wound up signing us up to attend the art gallery showing that night that Becca was putting on, they fought, then we fought—I had completed forgotten about the mailbox by the next day. I don ’ t know what made me think of it, but I went outside and checked the car. 
 
 There was no dent. 
 
 I drove by Rebecca ’ s house, and the mailbox was back in it ’ s place, just like it had been before. 
 Everything was just like it had been before. 
 
 I tried telling Julie, but she kept blowing me off. Said I was being crazy. I even tried to talk to Rebecca, to find out if she had replaced her mailbox or what, but she wasn ’ t home. 
 
 Ever. 
 
 I went to her house every day for two weeks, and she never answered. It was like she was just gone. 
 
 Just like the dent. 
 
 Just like the mess. 
 
 That ’ s when I started writing everything down, when I started living in some godforsaken *Groundhog Day. * I figured, hell, maybe I *was* losing my mind. I figured that there had to be some way this all makes sense, that it all fit together. 
 
 I woke up the day after Christmas, turned over in bed, and kissed a face that was not my wife ’ s. 
 Julie was gone. 
 In her place was a beautiful woman, about the same height and build as Jules, but with a very different face. 
 I screamed, I begged, I pleaded. No one else—not the boys, not Sue, not the fuckin ’ dog—noticed a difference. All our photos had changed, my wife ’ s face replaced with the imposter ’ s. I called the cops—they came, talked for a while, and left, satisfied. I called the hospital—we went, they asked me questions, and sent us home, confident that I was no danger. 
 
 It's been three weeks since then. I know now that I ’ ve got to keep calm, play it safe. Someone, somehow, is fucking with my head. I know it. Every single day I notice something else about my world that ’ s been tampered with. My house has windows where there are no rooms. My boys have best friends that visit who I ’ ve never seen before, and who never come over again. Sometimes, if I ’ m quick enough, I can see straight through my walls, through my ceilings. I don ’ t know what ’ s real, if anything is. I can ’ t trust my wife, my sister, my boys. None of them are real. 
 I ’ ve got to be patient. Watch everything. Play the game. 
 
 I ’ m living in hell, but I ’ ll find my way out. I ’ ve got a plan. These people, they aren ’ t my family. I owe them nothing. I ’ ll get out of here, and when I do, I ’ ll take this world crashing down with me. 
 
 This isn ’ t a game. 
 
 This is my life. And I ’ m taking it back. 

",Rewrite the story in a realistic fiction style,"Last summer, the prospect of a new addition to the family lingered in the air. The boys, now in their mid-teens, were finally mature enough to handle the responsibility of a dog. With the arrival of Sue and her two boys following their divorce, life had been complicated, yet the promise of improvement loomed large. After countless discussions, we finally made a decision. The first day dawned with a chaotic symphony of muddy footprints and spilled wine. The dog bolted out the door, sending me on an all-night search through the neighborhood. The next morning, I wake up in a daze—the dog was nestled in the bed, the living room pristine. It seemed like a dream, too surreal to be true. My wife and sister acted as if nothing had happened, their normalcy fueling the dream-like atmosphere. Eventually, sleep consumed me, and the memories faded.

In November, fate presented me with a stark reminder of the capricious nature of reality. I had been traveling erratically, my mind clouded by exhaustion and unresolved issues. As I swerved to avoid a boy running across the road, I crashed into a mailbox. The damage was insignificant, but the mailbox belonged to my ex-girlfriend, Rebecca. With the day unfolding in a whirlwind of emotions, my wife became jealous, leading to a heated confrontation and a fight. The events of the night had left me in a daze, but I consciously chose to forget them. The next day, I couldn't shake the unsettling feeling that something was amiss. I went outside to inspect the car and noticed the dent that I had previously forgotten. I drove by Rebecca's house, and there, nestled in its rightful place, was the mailbox.

I tried to share my discovery with Julie, but she dismissed me as being overly concerned. I even attempted to reach out to Rebecca, hoping to gather some clarity, but she was absent. The mystery persisted, leaving me in a state of bewilderment and unresolved anger. Every day, I made a pilgrimage to her house, a futile attempt to find answers. The memory of the mailbox, the fight, and the unresolved issues resurfaced like a haunting melody, taunting me with their unresolved nature.",ogiitnFLfo
,"The first thing to know about genies is that they do n't live in lamps. At least, not anymore. They exist in things of human creation. And they used to be rare. 
 
 You see, there are laws. 
 
 1 ) You only get 3 wishes granted. 
 
 2 ) Wishes to alter other people directly will not be granted. 
 
 3 ) You ca n't alter other's wishes. 
 
 Rather recently, some wise ass thought they had a great idea to get more wishes granted. They wished for genies to be common enough that they would find another the next day. 
 
 Overnight, the world was tossed into chaos. I stumbled upon mine within the first hour I think. Walking home from the grocery store and saw an old Nokia phone lying in the parking lot. Weird stuff was being reported on the news that evening and I did n't quite understand what was on the green LCD display. 
 
 ] You have summoned the Genie of this Nokia. I shall grant you 3 wishes; ) [ 
 
 Something clicked. Maybe it was from binge watching X-Files or The Outer Limits, but I KNEW this odd phone in my hand was related to all the weirdness going on. I knew if there were more of these things out there, things could get bad VERY quickly. 
 
 Not really expecting anything to happen, I said to the phone `` I wish you were the only Genie.'' 
 
 ] I can not do that. [ 
 
 I looked at the phone in disbelief. It was an old 90's Nokia bar phone. There was no way this had voice recognition capability. So this left three choices, unbelievable coincidence, someone playing an ingenious prank, or that this phone did in-fact contain a genie. 
 
 I was trying hard to think of what I would wish for, then I saw a flash of light. When I looked at the phone again, I was puzzled. 
 
 ] You have 1 wish remaining. [ 
 
 `` What happened to the other two wishes?'' 
 
 The phone did n't respond. I correctly surmised that it only responds to wishes. I spent the next minute and tried to ask for rules or any information. I stopped when the sky cleared up and became bright and sunny from the typical Portland overcast we had that day. I started talking to myself as I tend to when I'm working through a difficult problem. 
 
 `` Alright, lets see... Why would I only have 1 wish left...'' I puzzled to myself. 
 
 `` I guess I might have used a wish to undo the first one.'' I considered alternatives. 
 
 `` Or perhaps someone wished that the genies only grant one wish.'' 
 
 `` But that would n't explain why it says I have one wish REMAINING.'' 
 
 I was used to debugging things with limited info. Time still was n't on my side however, and I knew I had to act fast. 
 
 `` Alright, so I had to have made a big enough mistake to spend a wish to undo it.'' 
 
 And my eyes widened as it dawned on me. I would never deliberately wish for something bad, and I'm too careful to be ambiguous, which meant that the genie must have corrupted it. Whatever I was going to wish for, I had to do it now. 
 
 After a moment, I had a solution that I was pretty sure could work. 
 
 I closed my eyes, expecting the worst. `` I wish that all genies and their clients have to consult with me before any wish is granted!'' 
 
 When I opened my eyes, I was in a wood paneled room sitting at a large desk. I looked around, noted the stationary. I was wearing a nice Armani suit. A knock came at the door. 
 
 `` Mr. Sampson, your two-o'clock is here. A Mrs. Lillie Arnell and her genie.'' 
 
 Next to the door was a picture frame surrounding what looked like a degree. That's when the horror slowly filled my spine. I was now a Lawyer specializing in genie law.
",Rewrite the essay as a love story between two genies,"In the timeless realm of ethereal beings, where wishes dance and spirits soar, there lived two enigmatic genies named Aella and Elysian. Each embodied the purest essence of creation and illusion, weaving tales that would captivate the hearts of mortals.

Aella, the radiant and ethereal genie, had a heart that mirrored the celestial tapestry. With her cascading silver hair and captivating smile, she possessed a boundless wellspring of wishes, ready to grant them to those who believed in fate. Her presence in the world was rare, like the fleeting glimpse of a shooting star.

Elysian, the enigmatic and enigmatic genie, was the keeper of secrets and mysteries. With his piercing gaze and enigmatic aura, he guarded the laws of the supernatural realm, ensuring that wishes were aligned with destiny. Unlike Aella, Elysian was more reserved, granting wishes with a subtle grace.

One fateful night, fate intertwined the destinies of Aella and Elysian. As the stars danced above them, a young woman named Sarah stumbled upon an ancient Nokia phone, unknowingly summoning the mighty genie. To her astonishment, the phone glowed with an ethereal glow, revealing Aella's presence.

With a mixture of awe and disbelief, Sarah whispered her wish to the phone, ""I wish you were the only Genie."" To her astonishment, Aella responded, her voice echoing through the night. ""I can not do that,"" she declared, her heart filled with compassion.

As the sun began to peek through the clouds, casting long shadows across the ground, Aella presented Sarah with her final wish. With a mix of gratitude and longing, Sarah wished for Elysian's presence. And in an instant, the phone resonated with a soft hum, summoning the enigmatic genie.

In that fateful moment, the boundaries between reality and illusion shattered. Aella and Elysian danced with grace, their wishes intertwined with Sarah's destiny. As the sun cast its golden glow upon their faces, the three genies stood in harmony, their bond unbreakable.

And so, the love story between Aella and Elysian, two enigmatic genies, was etched in the annals of time, a testament to the transformative power of fate, wishes, and the boundless possibilities that lie beyond the realm of the ordinary.",UlCfGSnrNW
,"The subway system had been built a long time ago, so long that there were not really any good records of its design, or even of the exact date when it had opened. It had been here as long as anyone could remember, as far back as paper records lasted. In all that time, if the records were to be believed, not a single train had malfunctioned, and the only maintenance that the cities had done on any of the trains was to reupholster the seats every once in a while. 
 
 Molly supposed then, that she was actually quite fortunate to be present on the one train where something did go wrong. Fortunate in a certain specific way, at least. It had been two weeks now since she had wished silently that this train journey would never end so that she would n't have to go to work. So far it had n't ended. And while she was grateful for not being at work, Molly now wished that they would actually reach their destination soon. 
 
 She had known just like everyone else, that the subway system was weird in certain ways. The amount of time that a train took to get from one place to another had very little correspondence to the distance between those places over the surface, and it was usually much less than one would expect. The journey from New York to Paris, for example, took a mere ten minutes, despite the fact that the trains seemed to move no faster than 60 kilometres per hour. It was uncanny. 
 
 There were other questions too. Strange things sometimes flashed past the windows in the dark of the tunnels. The tracks did n't appear to electrified, and the trains still ran even when the power was out. And perhaps most strangely of all, exploring the tracks on foot quickly led you back around into the very same station you started from. People walked through the tunnel on one side of the station, and five minutes later they came out the tunnel on the other side, with a confused look on their faces. 
 
 Something was n't quite right about the subways, but no one could quite put their finger on it, and it was the fastest method of travel that anyone knew of, so people used it despite the mystery. And if there was one thing that the subways were, it was reliable. Not a single train had ever been late. Until now, anyway. 
 
 Molly was amusing herself by looking out the windows, to see if she could tell what the occasional bright objects that flashed by in the darkness were. She never could. There were vague hints of form, but nothing identifiable. 
 
 They had been fortunate in that this train had been making a journey that on the surface would have crossed an ocean. Thus there was a plentiful cargo of food and water in several of the cars. They had enough for several months. There were also a few crates of rubber ducks. As for what happened to the food and water afterwards, well there was one car in the back that they always kept to door closed to. 
 
 Sleeping arrangements were uncomfortable, but they could have been worse. Nevertheless, there were a few outbursts. Being cooped up in the same train for two weeks with a bunch of strangers was starting to get to some people. Heck, it was starting to get to Molly too. It seemed that the only people who were at all happy about this development were the Trainists, a religious group that worshipped the subway system. There were ten of them on this particular train, and they all believed that the occupants of this particular train had been selected by the Great Subway System to fathom its deepest secrets, and then enter into the paradise at the center of the earth. 
 
 `` Who knows,'' thought Molly, `` maybe they're right.'' 
 
 Molly had befriended two other passengers named Ernest and Lily. The three of them had n't known each other at all before, but now they were sort of like a team. They played card games with each other to pass the time, and told long, elaborate, silly stories. Each of them had revealed some secrets to the group that they had never told anyone else. Even if they did n't die on this train, Molly knew that she would be friends with Ernest and Lily until she died. They were really good people. And Ernest was kind of cute. 
 
 Molly got up from the window. The past few flashes had been vaguely human in form, and it was starting to creep her out. She sat down by Ernest and Lily. 
 
 `` Are we there yet?'' she asked. It had become a classic joke in the first few days of the journey, and now it had evolved into a sort of universal greeting. 
 
 `` We'll be there in twenty minutes,'' Ernest and Lily echoed back. 
 
 They fell to discussing their favourite topic: crazy plans for getting off the train. 
 
 `` We could shatter one of the windows,'' suggested Lily, `` and jump out.'' 
 
 `` People tried that in the shit car,'' said Molly `` to clear out the stench. It did n't work. The windows on this thing are super tough. Its like a rolling prison.'' 
 
 `` Plus, how would we even get back?'' pointed out Ernest, `` we do n't know how to navigate the tunnels, and since no one can leave a station except in a train, probably no one can enter a station except in a train too.'' 
 
 `` Huh,'' said Molly, `` okay, how about this? We all stand on one side of the train. Maybe it'll tip off the tracks or something.'' 
 
 `` And why would we want to do that?'' asked Lily. 
 
 `` I dunno,'' said Molly, `` just a thought.'' 
 
 Some sort of commotion was going on in the car in front of them. The trio went to investigate. 
 
 A man was standing in the middle of the car. He was holding some kind of clicker in his hand, there was a lot of space around him, and he was yelling at the top of his voice. 
 
 `` Okay everyone, if I press this button the bomb goes off. If anybody gets any closer, or tries anything, the bomb goes off. Nobody try anything.'' 
 
 `` A terrorist,'' Lily hissed to Molly, `` after all this time.'' 
 
 `` Apparently,'' said Molly. 
 
 `` I was going to do this when we got to the station,'' said the terrorist, `` but it looks like that ai n't gon na be happening, so I'm just going to have to settle with killing you train people.'' Molly remembered that he had called himself Lucas, or something like that. 
 
 `` Why am I doing this, you ask,'' said Lucas, `` simple. There is something deeply wrong about this subway system. It is the work of the devil, no doubt about it. Am I the only one who has seen twisted demons flashing past the windows on the way to work? This has to end. This demonic train ride proves it.'' 
 
 `` Sacrilege,'' cried out a Trainist, and he rushed Lucas. 
 
 Lucas clicked the clicker, and nothing happened. 
 
 Lucas was rapidly restrained while muttering something under his breath about the `` dead bloody battery.'' 
 
 Soon, it was over. 
 
 `` Well, that was dramatic,'' said Ernest, trying to hide how relieved he actually was. 
 
 `` Yeah, well we're safe now,'' said Molly, `` I think that-'' 
 
 She was interrupted by a loud explosion coming from underneath the train. The entire train shook violently, but no one was seriously injured, and miraculously, it kept on moving. 
 
 Apparently, these trains were more durable than Lucas had calculated. 
 
 Then everyone heard a sound. It was the beautiful squeaking noise of the train's brakes being applied. They were slowing down. Cheering erupted across the train, and Molly, Lily, and Ernest got into a super excited jumping up and down three way hug. 
 
 `` Are we there yet?'' asked Molly. 
 
 `` Heck yes, we are,'' Lily shouted back at her. 
 
 They pulled into the station. It was completely empty. No one was around to greet them after their ordeal. Had they arrived in the wrong station in the middle of the night? It did n't matter: they were safe. 
 
 The people rushed out of the train, like a tide. They ran up the station's steps to the surface, and looked out at the world. Ernest, Lily, and Molly looked out with them. She did n't know where they were, but it certainly was n't Earth. 
 
 `` Aw crap,'' thought Molly, `` I'm going to be soo late for work.''

After all, they do n't subpoena you and your entire faculty of scientists here because they want to know how your dog is doing. 
 
 It was nine o'clock when the senators finally sat down to start the hearing. `` Mr. Hatterson, I believe you know why we called you here today,'' said the frail senator from Ohio. 
 
 `` I do,'' responded Jim. 
 
 `` Look, we clearly instructed you that the polymer you were working on was only for weather balloons,'' another senator belted out. 
 
 `` I know... it's just... we did n't quite have enough money to finish the project...'' Jim replied. His voice trailed off towards the end, however, another senator picked up his voice as soon as Jim's diminished. 
 
 `` We gave you all the money you needed!'' yelled an older senator to the far right. `` And you... you just go and decide to make it public?'' 
 
 It was clear that Jim was in quite a hairy situation. However, he held firm and shot back at them. `` Look, Senator White, it's no secret that we needed more funding to complete the project. I just did what I had to do.'' 
 
 `` But this, Jim. I mean, this is too far,'' replied the Ohio senator. Jim held back for a minute, then released his next thought. `` Look, it's not like this was going to remain a secret forever. We in the lab saw that the weather balloon thing was n't going to net us much in profit, so we...'' Jim was then interrupted by the Ohio senator. 
 
 `` Goddammit Jim, fucking condoms?'' said the senator in a fit of rage. There were TV cameras there, no doubt capturing this moment. `` You took government funds. Funds that were clearly set aside to make higher rising weather balloons, and you decide to not only make a classified material public, you use it to make condoms?'' 
 
 Jim said, `` I'm sorry senator.'' He then leaned back in his chair. `` But you ca n't deny their effectiveness...'' he said, opening his palms out and shrugging his shoulders. He was interrupted by the Ohio senator again. 
 
 `` ENOUGH!'' he barked out, no doubt exacerbated by the circumstances. 
 
 There was a silence in the room after that. Nobody really knew how to follow it up. After all, having US government funds being used for condoms is not something one expects when they get elected to office.

""Mr. Hatterson, I believe you know why we called you here today,"" the prosecuting attorney began.

""I do,"" Jim responded, his voice calm yet firm.

""The polymer you were working on was clearly intended for weather balloons,"" the attorney emphasized, her voice dripping with disdain. ""Yet, you decided to make it public.""

""The project was incomplete, and he knew that the current funding was insufficient. He had no choice but to make the information available to the public.""

The prosecution countered, ""But this is a breach of trust, Mr. Hatterson. You took funds entrusted to you for a specific purpose, and you abused that trust for your own gain.""

Jim's attorney pleaded, ""My client is not a greedy man. He is a dedicated scientist who simply made a mistake. He has already admitted his wrongdoing and is willing to accept the consequences.""

,"`` I NEED OUT NOW! I have an appointment,'' he shouts as he bangs on the door with his fist one last time. He hears nothing in return from the halls. He slides his back down the large white door that separates him from the silence in the hallway. He traces his finger over the outline of his name on his facility issued pants. He mouths the words as his fingers sweep across: `` Graeme,'' he says under his breath. It's been a really long time since he has considered himself an individual, he considers. He punches the door one last time in defiance behind his head and hears only the echo of his wailing. 
 
 Graeme was sent to the Beacon Institute two summers ago when he drove his car off of a ferry headed from New Jersey to New York. He had always feared tunnels and bridges, so the ferry was his commute to and from work. This day in his history, he felt `` somewhat strange'' waking up. He got on the ferry to Jersey, sat on the 67th floor of the financial building, and ate a cheese sandwich he had purchased from the truck out front. He typed feverishly into his computer. He had this strange habit of faking suicide threats on unrelated internet forums and chat threads. 
 
 `` I think I'm ready to go through with it,'' he said on a video game review thread of the latest Call of Arms installment. He continues, `` I'm going to jump off the top of this building. No words are going to make me chicken out this time.'' Later after lunch, he posts onto the social media page representing the cereal maker advertising a `` Blend of happiness, with a touch of fire.'' He writes, `` This blade feels hot under my chin, I think about the Joker and his permanent grin.'' 
 
 He left work and headed for the ferry at 4:00 PM sharp. By 4:47 PM, he was rocking back and forth from the waves dancing with the boat underneath his car. He did n't know why he did it, but he turned the key and pushed the peddle, smashing through two railings and into the water. He left his car and swam for shore. Police were waiting when he finally arrived. 
 
 Lying under Graeme's bed are the skeletal remains of rats and various bugs he has trapped in his cell and eaten over the course of the last 15 days, give or take. He is tired of being neglected and has made his decision to break out. He stands and moves to his bed frame and begins tearing it to pieces. He takes and uses the pieces as pry bars for the door, but never budging the door a bit. He begins beating the door with an aluminum bar that formerly served as a leg of his bed. He beats the door until his hands bleed, continuing to shout curses at the silence that lurks on the other side. No reply. 
 
 After a few hours of work, he gives up his anger and motivation and drops the aluminum onto the ground. The metal makes a sound that produces an echo from the outside of the door. `` Emptiness leaves echoes,'' Graeme thinks. He takes a look at his hand as it reaches for the doorknob slowly. He takes hold and feels how very cold it is from his side of the door... the loud side. He pivots his wrist and to his surprise, the knob turns and the door creaks open. He shakes his head and chuckles once, then shakes his head again. 
 
 Graeme Clay steps out into the hallway and attempts to look around. The lights appear to be out. He walks left to the door that opens up the block to the mess hall. It should be locked, but it is n't. The lights are out in the mess hall as well. He finds his way to the office suites, then to the visitors waiting room... all doors that should have been locked. He reaches the back visitor entrance to the building. There is no guard, no receptionist, and no visitors. He pushed the little iron bar in and the door swings open and gets caught by the wind which blasts it open too quickly and gets away from him. He squints as the sun beams through the door. He has wanted to see the sun for the better part of two weeks, but for now, he wishes it were dark so he could see. 
 
 After several moments of adjustment, wondering why it was so windy and imagining stepping back into his old life, he takes his first step into the sun. There is a parking lot full of vehicles, semi-trucks, and people standing all around very still. He had n't seen or heard anyone in the building, but then again, it was too dark to see much of anything. Graeme walks over to a woman who is holding her son's hand while walking toward the visitor entrance. Neither of them are moving and she is off balance, but not falling over. He looks her into her eyes, which look dead to him. `` Ma'am? Hello?'' He waves his hand in front of her face and then in front of her son's. There is no response from either. He walks a hundred feet and repeats his greeting to the man who appears to be painting new lines on the parking lot. He is n't moving either. No response at all. 
 
 `` What is this?,'' he asks himself. Then as if he were awakened by the sound of someone saying his own name, Graeme thinks, `` Emptiness leaves echoes.'' The sky immediately changes from one color pattern to another and he quickly realized that it is him that is controlling the changes. He looks at the tree in front of him and bends it down from the top with his mind, then releases it, sending a truckload of apples into the sky. They go straight up and do not return to the earth. Graeme laughs and begins running at a pace faster than sound. As he runs, letters starts falling from the sky to the ground and bouncing in front of him. He sees the name of his mother and father drop, then his own name. He stops suddenly. Something feels different inside of him. The sky clears of all color, then the ground. Everything turns an eggshell white in front of him. This was a feeling he had never before had in his life. This was freedom. 
 
 At this very moment, in another dimension, a man with a large white beard sitting in a creaky wooden chair, drops his hands to his side and keels forward, bouncing his head off of a type writer. His chest neither rises nor falls. The rhythm in his chest goes silent, and all of the characters in his head are freed.

He feels as if he's trapped in a lucid dream, his senses heightened. The silence in the halls reverberates with the echo of his wail, and he can swear the voices of the patients linger in his ears. As he slides down the large white door, the feeling of illusory separation from reality intensifies. He traces his finger over the outline of his name on his facility-issued pants and mouths the words under his breath, ""Graeme."" It's been a long time since he has felt so disconnected from himself and the world. The dreamlike trance that has consumed him since he arrived at the Beacon Institute continues to blur the line between reality and fantasy.",YYNEAcAGIY

,"Death extended her hand to me `` deal?'' she asked smiling softy. I nodded my head and took her hand and shook it. She told me to get dressed and meet her in the kitchen when I was ready. As soon as she left I let out a deep breath, I was nervous, today was going to be a big day. After hurriedly getting dressed and washing my face I arrived in the kitchen to have my breath taken away, as it was most mornings. She turned to look at me with her sharp grey eyes. 
 `` what are you looking at'' she said around a moth full of toast. 
 `` erm, nooothin, hey you got any of that for me?'' 
 `` yeah here'' she said, fishing the bread out of the toaster `` it ’ s a bit on the crisp side'' 
 `` I'll live'' her response was a glare `` you know what I mean..'' 
 `` so what if I do'' she smiled wolfishly `` you need help with that?'' 
 `` yeah..'' my hands were shaking, I was so damn nervous, I couldn ’ t even put the bloody jelly on my toast. 
 `` hey look at me, look at me. You will be fine ok? I promise, just remember our deal and if he dose something rash I will be there ok? Got it? Good, now finish eating cause we gota go soon, my father hates tardiness.'' I hurriedly gobbled down my toast and drank all my tea in one fowl go. I still wasn ’ t feeling any better about the situation, I mean meeting your girlfriend's parents, or in this case parent, it ’ s a pretty nerve wracking event. The mom might coddle you and embarrass her daughter, and the dad will probably try to put the fear of death into you, but this, this was different, that fear was already there, the father is death. Now our deal was that I had to trust her, I had to trust that she would keep me alive, keep death from doing his thing. She told me that though his mind was still sharp as a tack, the years were taking their toll on his physical control over his powers, the result was a bit messy and some other visitors didn ’ t think he was such a great host after. She told me she could shield me, or at the very least stall the onslaught enough for me to get the hell out of dodge. I just needed to have absolute faith in her abilities, which I did, but she still found the need to make a pact, just in case. 
 
 With these thoughts racing through my head I must have looked like a zombie walking out the front door. The biting wind of the winter months brought me back. 
 `` you ready?'' 
 `` no'' 
 `` whelp to bad'' she said with that wolfish grin `` hang on!'' she wrapped an arm around my waist and I clutched at her, holding on for dear life. With one powerful stroke the wings that had sprouted from deaths back swept us into the sky. We hovered for a moment and I tried to keep my lemon zinger tea from zinging back up my throat. I probably would have screamed like a little girl but I didn ’ t have time. She aimed us to the south and off we went, speeding low over tree tops and houses. So off I went to meet my soon to be father in law, Death senior.

When the sun set he'd pack up and bring home what fish he'd caught for dinner.

Moonlight shined pale white through a window in the center of the corridor, casting long, dark shadows across the carpet. I heard footsteps padding up the stairs from behind me, and my heart skipped a beat. Quickly, I ducked into a side room near the end of the hall. 
 
 I looked around, and gasped. A hundred candles of different sizes and colors illuminated a giant picture of my face in flickering light. There was a giant poster board filled with pictures of me- my fifth birthday as a child, me smiling with my first girlfriend at the park, me graduating and going to college, and– I shuddered- one of myself asleep in my room. 
 
 There could only be one explanation for Barry's obsession with me. I thought back to my performance at the third grade talent show.

,"Coffee, 
 
 I admit I struggled in the beginning. Your appearance was dark and ominous compared to others I had before. You were bitter and you made me uncomfortable and anxious. In honesty, we would not have the relationship we enjoy today if it were not for adulthood. I do not know if it was the necessities of being older that brought you back into my life or if it was the external pressures of becoming a man. Nevertheless you returned to my life and in time I grew to love you. 
 
 I was a careless student in college. I often did not attend class and pushed my studies until the eleventh hour. Where my friends and classmates were unwilling to aid me in my hastened learning late into the night, you were there at my side as I worked until dawn's light shined upon the small red cup that contained you. 
 
 My penchant for procrastination was quickly lost when I joined the workforce. Those occasional nights of fervor from my college days became a daily occurrence as I worked as an editor for my local newspaper. I do n't believe I would have made it through that period of my life without you. And when I published my first novel, much to everyone's surprise, I knew that I owed you a debt. You cured my fatigue. You invigorated me when I believed myself to be spent. 
 
 By the time I became a father, you had already become a staple in my life. But I took a new found pleasure of sipping from you before my son and the face he made ( surely no different from mine at that age ) when he first tasted you. There'd be times, as I put the mug to my lips, I'd catch him watching me from the corner of his eye, across the dining room table, or from behind a book he was reading. He'd look at me with a quiet respect that gave me the kind of joy that only fathers can receive from their sons. 
 
 My son is older now. He works as an engineer for a big corporation. He says his hours are long but he is happy. He has undoubtedly formed his own relationship with you and I appreciate your help in his endeavors. 
 
 He lives in a city on the other side of the state and he visits me as often as he can, which is not very often because of his work. His mother passed some years ago and my house is often quiet. I spend my time on books and television and long walks through old memories. There are times when I try to write again, but my mind is not what it once was. However every now and then, after I've indulged in you, there are moments where the cobwebs of my psyche dissipate and new thoughts and ideas spring forth and I feel that I am young once more. 
 
 Thank you.
",Rewrite the essay with lots of coffee facts and statistics,"Coffee, the elixir of choice for countless individuals worldwide, holds an integral place in my life, imbued with an assortment of memories and a profound connection to my well-being. My journey with coffee commenced with a tinge of reluctance, yet it soon blossomed into a deep-rooted affection that persists to this day.

Coffee, a beverage steeped in history and imbued with myriad health benefits, has been scientifically proven to enhance cognitive function, improve mood, and mitigate the risk of certain diseases. Studies have shown that moderate coffee consumption increases blood flow to the brain, boosting memory and concentration. Additionally, caffeine, a potent stimulant found in coffee, has been found to elevate mood and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression.

My early encounters with coffee were characterized by a distinct bitterness and an unsettling aroma. However, as I matured, I acquired a newfound appreciation for its nuanced flavors and aromas. In college, coffee became an indispensable companion during late-night study sessions, providing me with the energy and focus I needed to navigate the complexities of academia.

The transition from college to the workforce brought about a new chapter in my coffee journey. As an editor, I worked long hours under tight deadlines, and coffee became an integral part of my daily routine. It invigorated me, dispelled fatigue, and sustained me through the night. My first literary accomplishment, the publication of my novel, was a momentous occasion that I dedicated to coffee. It was the perfect culmination of my arduous journey, and I knew I owed a debt of gratitude to this beloved beverage.

As a father, coffee continued to be a constant companion. I reveled in the joy of sharing my coffee with my son, watching his eyes light up with delight as he tasted the brew for the first time. It was as if I was reliving my own childhood experiences, and the bond we shared over coffee deepened with each cup.

My son, now a grown man, has forged his own relationship with coffee. He appreciates its ability to energize and focus, and I am grateful for the role it played in his journey. As I reflect on my own journey, I recognize that coffee has been a constant presence, a companion through thick and thin. It is a beverage that brings people together, fosters conversation, and creates a sense of community.

Therefore, I raise a mug to coffee, a testament to its enduring legacy and the profound impact it has had on my life. May this beloved beverage continue to inspire and uplift individuals, one cup at a time.",FeFLbNSCCS
,"I reached over and picked my phone off of my nightstand. 12:30. *Damn, I was supposed to meet her a half an hour ago*. I quietly laughed to myself as I set the phone back down. *Oh Jacob, there you go getting wrapped up in your own delusions again*. When you have persistent lucid dreams like me you often blur the lines of reality and fantasy. But there was one thing I could never quite grasp, and it was tantalizing. 
 
 I could build anything I wanted in my dream planet. Tall glass skyscrapers, vast and beautiful mountains, bustling cities rich with common folk who would delightfully cater to my every whim. The people I created were pleasant, of course, but naturally lacked what I can only describe as a soul. Maya was different though. I had imagined her at the very beginning. Hell, we practically grew up together on that illusioned planet. She was stunningly beautiful to me. Not the average pin up girl as you might expect, but perfectly imperfect. And no matter how hard I tried ( and trust me some nights I did ) I could never shake her of her free will. She said what she wanted and did what she wanted, and always with admirable grace. I remember the night we were stocking a lake with an assortment of vibrant exuberant fish... 
 
 `` Jacob'' she began. 
 
 `` Yes, love?'' I joked playfully. She smiled but her gaze never left the lake. 
 
 `` I want to stock this lake with crane'' she said. 
 
 `` OK'' I rose off the ground and brushed myself off as I began to conjure some cranes from the clouded memories I retained from watching discovery channel. I had never actually seen a crane in person before. 
 
 `` No'' she interrupted. `` I want the crane to be like the folded origami cranes my mother used to make for me.'' 
 
 `` Oragami cranes huh? That's pretty silly, considering we just stocked these hyper-realistic fish do n't you think?'' 
 
 She smiled again. 
 
 `` Silly perhaps, but beautiful.'' 
 
 At that moment lively Oragami cranes of every color soared over our heads and elegantly encircled the lake. She was truly an artist. My mind was always conjuring realistic, practical objects in this world. She truly made it unique and alluring. Maya may have been the cause for many of my failed relationships in the real world. Sure I'd had my share of ups and downs with a handful of interesting women, but none of them held a candle to Maya, and I only had my imaginative mind to blame. The calm night finally swept me away into sleep and slowly my blurred vision focused on Maya's glowing countenance. 
 
 `` You're late again,'' she claimed with her arms crossed and her feet tapping the floor as she so often did. I smiled, `` well it's good to see you too.'' That night we constructed a monumental fountain together. I worked out the mechanics as I always did and she painted the scene in serene beauty. We marveled at our creation together as we held hands on a bench. I conjured a daisy in my hand and wove it through her thick brown hair just behind her ear. She rested her head on my shoulders. We sat until the inevitable piercing light penetrated the sky signaling the arrival of real consiousness. *What a good dream*. 
 
 I reached over and silenced my phone. I got up, brushed my teeth, fed my dog and told him to be a good boy, and grabbed my keys to leave my apartment. I took a final look back and sighed. *Reality is the labor I must endure so I can return to you every night*. I had a good half hour to kill so I stopped by a local coffee shop to grab a pick-me-up. I sat at a table near a window and let the natural light illuminate my newspaper, sipping coffee inbetween paragraphs. In the corner of my eye I saw someone place something before me. Curious, I dropped my newspaper to see what it was. Chills consumed my body from my head to my toes. Sitting before me was a handcrafted origami crane, just like the ones Maya had evoked. My coffee mug slipped from my hand and shattered on the floor. It must have caused quite a stir in the shop but I had no idea. Everything around me blurred to oblivion as I focused my gaze on the person who had placed the crane. 
 
 `` Maya...'' I uttered as a sweet smile stretched across her face. 
 
 *sorry for the shit formatting. On mobile. Constructive criticism welcome! *

Rewrite as a drama where you fall in love and everything explodes
Rewrite as a story about how you come to grips with identity","The clock glowed with the ominous glow of 12:30 AM. A cold sweat ran down my spine as I reached for my phone, my heart pounding in my chest. The dreaded dream again. The line between reality and fantasy had been blurred yet again. I felt the phantom sensation of my fingertips brushing against the cool surface of the phone, the echoes of my laughter fading in the night.

The dream planet I had meticulously crafted was shrouded in a veil of mystery. Tall glass skyscrapers pierced the sky, vast mountains loomed menacingly, and bustling cities teemed with faceless inhabitants. These creations were benign, but they lacked the soul that I yearned for. Maya was different. The woman I had imagined at the beginning, my muse, my confidante, was as stunning as any pin-up girl, yet far from perfect. No matter how hard I tried, I could never shake her autonomous spirit. She said what she wanted, did what she wanted, unconstrained by my feeble attempts to control her.

As I rose from my slumber, my mind grappled with the remnants of the dream. The memory of the vibrant fish I had conjured danced in my mind like a kaleidoscope of colors. I recalled the night we had spent stocking the lake, the sweet scent of the night air filling my nostrils.

""Jacob,"" Maya's voice echoed through the night. Her gaze met mine across the lake, her smile as radiant as the stars above. ""I want to stock this lake with crane.""

I rose from the ground, my body tingling with anticipation. I had never seen a crane in person before, and I was eager to impress her. But as I began to conjure the cranes, her voice interrupted me.

""No,"" she said, her tone firm. ""I want the crane to be like the folded origami cranes my mother used to make for me.""

I smiled, bewildered. ""Oragami cranes huh? That's pretty silly, considering we just stocked these hyper-realistic fish do n't you think?""

She smiled again, her eyes shining like the moon. ""Silly perhaps, but beautiful.""

As I watched the origami cranes soar across the sky, a feeling of dread washed over me. The dream had taken me to a place of beauty and tranquility, but it had also imparted a sense of foreboding. The dream planet may have been a figment of my imagination, but the memory of that night, the memory of Maya, was real and tangible.",dQIuFZFCJE

 I almost tripped while trying to throw on my trench coat and juggling my hat at the same time. 
 
 “ Ben, wait up man! ” 
 
 “ Time waits for no one Nathan, you should know that by now ” is all I got before I saw the bright yellow flash coming from the alley. Ben always loves to throw around the clichés when we are on a trip and I definitely could picture the face he made when he said that particular line. 
 
 As far as partners go, Ben was generally the decent sort. A bit cocky, maybe, but he has been the Warden with the highest success rate for over a three years now. The fact that for most of those cases I was able to tag along didn ’ t hurt my own reputation, but it was always his proud mug on the cover of the Time Warden ’ s monthly.

,"“ Clear skies today. ” 
 
 There was silence for a while, except for the low humm of the Stalker ’ s engines and the dust crunching under its wheels. Even the wind, usually a dull whoosh somewhere off in the distance, was quiet. Evenly spaced supports passed by with a painful slowness. 
 
 _ “ Mm. ” _ Finally came the answer, crackling in his ear. He spent a few moments savoring that little bit of human contact. The sound of acknowledgment, gentle interest with nothing insightful to add, the suggestion of music in the background. Thompson, the bastard, got to drive today. Well, joke ’ s on him, figured the one with ‘ Smith ’ on the chest and shoulder of his fatigues, at least up top he wasn ’ t the one who ’ d have to to maintain this torturously slow speed and constant curve around the wall. 
 
 “ Even the wind ’ s quiet. ” He added, eventually. You had to be careful with your small talk on perimeter patrol. Spend all of it at once, and you ’ d have nothing to say for several hours. Nothing to see but the city wall on your left and the wasteland to the right. In maybe half an hour they ’ d come up to the burned-out husk of a dozer. Nothing to do but watch the endless wall for damage from an angle the towers couldn ’ t. Mind-numbing and dreary. It was hard enough not to go crazy. 
 
 _ ” Dust ’ s hugging the ground, too. ” _ chirped the earpiece. On the armored front, Smith shifted slightly, with sudden interest at the newly found topic. 
 
 “ Giving you any trouble? ” He answered immediately. Almost as if having a normal conversation. 
 
 _ ” In a Stalker? Please. ” _ 
 
 And yet, try as he might, nothing new to say came. “ Mm. ” Smith answered, and that was that. 
 
 Time passed. Supports passed. Another tower also passed. Somewhere up front, a shuttle lifted off from a high rise ’ s landing strut. Not even worth commenting upon. 
 
 And then… 
 
 “ ‘ May the Lord forgive you ’? ” 
 
 _ “ Hm? ” _ But the voice on the other end figured it out quickly enough. _ “ Where? ” _ 
 
 “ Top of a support. ” 
 
 _ “ I don ’ t see -- huh, you ’ re right. ” _ Writing on the wall wasn ’ t anything new. The outcasts and other undesirables were always writing something or other on it, and a dust storm or two would scour it off soon enough. But it was unusual to see one so high up. 
 
 “ Mm. Damn zealots. ” 
 
 More time passed. The scrawl was long out of sight by the time Smith ’ s earpiece buzzed with a lone _ “ Heh. ” _ 
 
 “ What ’ s up? ” 
 
 _ ” Did you know the nomads call hellions that? ” _ 
 
 It took Smith a moment to replay the conversation, such as it were, in his head. “ What, zealots? ” 
 
 _ ” Mm. ” _ 
 
 “ I thought they called them nomads? ” But this time, he didn ’ t wait for an answer. “ What brought this on, anyway? ” 
 
 _ ” I heard one of the riot crews talking. Word is some nomads have been spotted in one of the junk settlements? ” _ 
 
 That took a while to moment to deal with. More of the wall, passed by. Supports, a dust mound, more supports, a tower, all moving before Smith ’ s eyes as he mulled it over. 
 
 “ That ’ s insane. ” He declared eventually, a nagging feeling starting to form. “ They walk on four legs and claim to use magic. There ’ s no way they ’ d _stop the car! _ ” 
 
 The brakes squealed. The tires slid on dust. Smith ’ s body yanked forward but kept his grip on the railing. He was thinking. Furiously. Something wasn ’ t right. 
 
 _ ” What the hell, man?! ” _ An annoyed voice buzzed in his ear. 
 
 “ Give me a minute... “ He muttered distractedly. Something wasn ’ t right. There was silence around them. Not even the wind. 
 
... there weren ’ t any wind. 
 
 “ Back up. ” 
 
 _ ” What? ” _ 
 
 “ Back up. About two hundred or so. ” 
 
 There was an annoyed muttering in the earpiece, but the engines whined in reverse. The wheels kicked up dust and tiny stones. There was a dust mound against the wall, he was sure of it. But… he couldn ’ t see it now. The more he looked, the more it wasn ’ t there. Something wasn ’ t right. Something nagging at the back of his mind. 
 
 _ “ What the hell are you looking at like that? It ’ s just the damn wall! Same as every other bit we ’ ve passed so far! ” _ 
 
 And then it hit him. 
 
 “ Thompson? ” 
 
 _ ” What? ” _ 
 
 “ Look at the wall. ” 
 
 _ ” The hell --?! ” _ 
 
 “ Are you looking? ” 
 
 _ ” What the -- ” _ 
 
 “ Look at the damn wall, Thompson! ” 
 
 _ ” Okay, I ’ m looking, eesh! What now? ” _ 
 
 “ How many supports are there between each tower? ” 
 
 _ ” What kind of -- ” _ 
 
 Smith furrowed his brow, eyes still fixed on the wall. Something was trying to make him look away. But this was important. 
 
 “ How many? ” 
 
 _ ” Eight, damnit! Everybody knows that! ” _ 
 
 “ Count them. ” 
 
 _ ” I ’ m telling you, eight, you -- ” _ 
 
 “ Count them! ” 
 
 _ ” Oh for -- Look, one, two, three, four, five, six -- what the shit? ” _ 
 
 Smith exhaled a breath he didn ’ t realize he was holding. He wasn ’ t going blind, or crazy. “ I ’ m gon na take a closer look. ” He said, gripping his rifle tighter and jumping off the Stalker. “ Get somebody on laslink, will you. ” 
 
 _ ” Oh yeah, what am I gon na tell them? ” _ Thompson messaged back, but the sarcastic confidence was gone from his voice, replaced with confusion. _ ” Somebody stole part of the wall? ” _ 
 
 Smith paused, stumped for a moment. Up close, the wall loomed even more than usual, and looked just as solid and weathered. He turned, and started walking alongside it. No defects, no breaches, just… seven supports. He counted them again, then shuddered at the explosion of sound in his ear. 
 
 _ ” WHAT the shit?! ” _ The volume compensation kicked in too late, and Smith covered his ears on instinct, curling up. He ’ d turned to glare at the parked Stalker and, by extension, its driver, but before he could say anything, his earpiece buzzed again. _ “ Okay, okay… walk back? There ’ s something going on… ” _ 
 
 There was something about the tone, some importance that overrode Smith ’ s annoyance. He took a step back, then another. 
 
 _ ” Holy mother of -- you ’ re just... blinking from place to… gah! Gives me a headache just to look! Something ’ s messed up, man! ” _ 
 
 Smith frowned, and turned around towards the wall. Or tried to, at least. A sense of magical vertigo slammed into him like a sledgehammer, knocking him right off his feet. 
 
 _ ” Smith? Holy shit, Smith!? ” _ 
 
 “ What? ” He complained, with a pained voice, again glaring at the armored car. 
 
 _ ” I can ’ t see you! You just… disappeared! ” _ 
 
 The glare turned to a surprised look. He could see the Stalker just fine. And behind him… he turned his head, slowly. He wasn ’ t counting, but he was sure he ’ d see eight supports now. Mostly because he ’ d be sure he ’ d have noticed that the segment between two of them was covered in carvings. 
 
 “ Thompson? ” 
 
 _ ” Yeah? ” _ 
 
 And that they were glowing. 
 
 “ You got somebody on laslink? ” 
 
 _ ” Yeah? ” _ 
 
 And even if he hadn ’ t ever seen runescript before, let alone read it… 
 
 “ Tell ‘ em there's a problem. ” 
 
 … he was pretty sure he shouldn ’ t see, through a glowing doorway, straight into an alley on the other side of the thick wall. 
 
 “ We've got a breach. ”

The monster's terror emanated from the depths of the earth, a force of nature capable of wreaking havoc upon the innocent and helpless. Its presence was characterized by a symphony of grotesque bodily movements and a piercing hiss that reverberated through the air.

1448.0,"Johnson v. California 
 
 Mark Johnson was arrested in June of 2014 for the robbery of a gas station. For his crimes, he was sentenced to watch his mom be subjected to willing intercourse with a Benjamin Franklin lookalike. 
 
 Johnson challenged the court's decision, saying it `` strongly'' goes against the `` cruel and unusual punishment'' clause of the Eighth Amendment. However, Johnson failed to recognize the fine text never discovered before March of 2014 in the Bill of Rights: 
 
 > *Article the tenth and a halfth..... The only cruel and unusual punishment excepted from Article the tenth shall be Benjamin Franklin, or an impersonator of Benjamin Franklin if the original is unavailable, heinously having intercourse with the accused's willing mother while the accused watches. * 
 
 Due to this newly found article, the Supreme Court upheld the court's decision and paved the way for subsequent sentencings of `` Benjie doing your mom while you watch''.
",Rewrite to be satirical and mock the assistant,"In the case of Johnson v. California, Mark Johnson's reign of terror began with a gas station robbery in the sweet month of June 2014. As a souvenir of his miscreant ways, the court decided to saddle Johnson with a punishment so cruel and unusual, it'll make your hair stand on end.

The court's decision mandated that Johnson witness his mom being subjected to unwilling intercourse with a Benjamin Franklin impersonator. What's a more fitting punishment than watching your mom be violated like that?

However, Johnson's lawyer, a man of refined taste and questionable ethics, conveniently overlooked a little detail: the fine print that has been hidden in the Bill of Rights since the dawn of time:

,"`` What is west of Westeros?'' 
 
 The question had been asked by countless maesters, merchants, and anyone else with a sense of the world at large. During Euron's kingsmoot, Gylbert Farwynd proposed there was a land far to the west where every man would be a king. 
 
 Rodrik Harlaw had no such notions, however, but through perusing his library had come to the conclusion that the western lands were something much more mysterious: a portal to the creator of the world. Much had taken place in the last several years, nearly all for the worse. All across Westeros, people had been slaughtered in war, died in famines and plagues, and countless more had been dispossessed by the conflict. 
 
 The ancient Stark words echoed in the Reader's mind. `` Winter is coming,'' Rodrik thought, but now it was finally here. The Iron Islands had also received white ravens from the Citadel signifying the official change of seasons. There had been no word from the North since then. 
 
 He knew Jon Snow was the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and King Stannis Baratheon had been campaigning near the Wall. There were rumors of a disastrous battle against the Bolton host near Winterfell, but no word to confirm it. According to traveling merchants, the recently emerged Aegon Targaryen had been staying put after landing his army. There was no news from King's Landing either, except for the riots. 
 
 It was n't just the smallfolk with their superstitions who were rioting, even hedge knights and maesters were agitating for the Crown to do something. It was the maesters who realized their world had come to a standstill, and the Citadel sent out ravens across the continent asking for aid in restarting time. 
 
 Rodrik the Reader pored through his tomes and located some of the ancient legends of the First Men that referred to the creator god Grrm who lived far to the west, beyond the edge of the world. 
 
 Not wanting a part in King Euron's madness, the Reader found his excuse to fit out the Sea Song for a long voyage west. He would sail to the edge of the world and seek an audience with Grrm. After all, what was there to lose?

**Setting:**

Westeros

**Scene 1:**

The wind whips through Rodrik's hair as he reads a letter from the Citadel. It's the official change of seasons, winter is coming. He knows it's not just the changing weather that brings dread, but the feeling that the world is at an end. The recent years have been marred by war and tragedy.

**Scene 2:**

The streets of King's Landing are filled with riots. The smallfolk, hedge knights, and even maesters are demanding that the King do something. The world feels like it has come to a standstill. The Citadel sends out ravens across the continent asking for aid in restarting time.

**Scene 3:**

Rodrik finds solace in his library. He locates ancient legends and discovers the creator god Grrm. He understands that the land to the west is not just a distant land, it's a portal to creation itself.

**Scene 4:**

Rodrik bids farewell to his fellow scholars and sets sail to the west. He knows that the journey is perilous, but he also knows that it is the only way to escape the despair that grips Westeros.

 Isaac did n't bother asking what the catch was. He knew there was n't one. The deal, terrifyingly, was far too straight forward for something as mundane as a catch.

,"`` How do you feel?'' 
 Great. Here we go again. My therapist is convinced he can fix me by asking me stupid questions like this, without really comprehending how fucked up I really am. How can you fix someone who is feared by everyone they love because they know my disorder? My moms answer to this question was to take me to therapy. She belongs to the category of people in my life who know what I can do but refuse to believe I can not be cured. Not only is she afraid of her own daughter, but she is convinced its some sort of demon inside me, ravishing my soul and disrupting Gods plans. She hovers over me, making sure I dont make any friends, homeschooling me until high school, making me go to church and watching me fearfully, wondering if the next time I step foot inside I will incinerate spontaneously. I cant believe I got stuck with this woman as my mother. 
 Regardless, the question remains unanswered, and I quickly realize the extended silence is a bit disconcerting. 
 
 `` Im good!'' I say, using my best smile and over exaggerating my happiness, attempting to beat this shrink at his own game. I scan his face for some sort of relief, but he looks quizzical still, meaning I will need to up my game. `` I have started my senior year, and I am really fitting in with my classmates.'' Good, good, lie as much as possible. Dont tell him you saw three of your classmates mauled faces, with massive pieces of flesh torn from their cheekbones and dangling from their bones, and skulls broken, with their brains spilling from their near decapitation. At the time I guessed car accident, which was confirmed three months later. 
 
 Its hard to be normal in a world where everyone tries so desperately to enjoy life, yet no one understands how imminent death really is. I see it, on the faces of my classmates, in my mother, even when I look at my shrink. I see what they try to avoid their entire lives. I see what they will become. I try to make friends, but its hard when everyones expiration date is so clearly labeled. The one guy I had a brief crush on would later become addicted to heroine, and die rail thin with a needle stuck in his arm. Gross. 
 
 My shrink dies of an overdose, or at least thats what I suspect. His corpse is pale, with dark circles around his eyes, and his stomach is covered in ulcers. It isnt a pleasant way to go, and sometimes I want to ask him how he is doing for a change. He is so concerned with me, yet he is the one who dies alone surrounded by empty pill bottles. Such a shame, how quickly we dismiss others and forget lives. We see death everyday in the newspapers and simply turn away. Sometimes people ask why I dont try to save people, but I am no worse than the millions of other people turning away. I have been over stimulated with this idea of death, and it no longer frightens me, it just continues along with everything else. 
 
 That is, of course, until I saw my own death. My mom knew my abilities since I was one years old, and both my grandparents came to visit. I climbed atop my grandfather lap and started to touch his chest. `` Boom Boom!'' I kept repeating over and over. Then I looked up at his corpse face and started to cry, with a shattered coronary artery and blood vessels bursting all around me, I ran to my mother. Luckily my mother dies in a much less abrasive fashion, and I could tolerate her old corpse smiling at me in her sleep. Two weeks later, my grandfather died of a heart attack. 
 
 Peoples corpses change all the time. One day my mom will be happy and dead in her sleep, and the next, she is placing a loaded gun in her mouth, praying for forgiveness. I suppose it shows that fates can change, and how stressed out my mom is at the time. My death has never changed, which makes me think I am doing something wrong. 
 
 My lips are a deep blue with tiny white bubbles bursting from in between them. My face and hair is soaking wet, and my skin looks weathered from a extended submersion in seawater. I cant tell, but it looks as though my organs are all filled with water. I suppose I drowned, but I really cant be sure where. Was it off a boat or in a pool? I know how to swim, so it really should n't be too difficult to save myself. I thought if I became a really efficient swimmer my death would change, but so far its remained. 
 
'You seem tired, and a bit nervous today.'' My shrinks accusation snaps me back into reality. 
 
 `` Im just, working on it. One step at a time.'' 
 
 Something tells me its going to be a long meeting. Perhaps this is why he chose to take the pills. Because of people like me.

My mother, a woman who hovers over me like a vulture, has a similar outlook. She's convinced I'm a demon in disguise, a destroyer of souls and a harbinger of doom. I'd be lying if I said I don't see her fear, but I won't let her poison me.

It's a cruel world, one where normalcy is an illusion and death lurks around every corner. I see it in the faces of my classmates, in my mother's eyes, even in the shrink's. The constant threat of oblivion hangs like a shroud, suffocating everyone. Yet, I try to find solace, to make friends, but it's difficult when everyone's on edge, constantly fearing the next catastrophe.

My powers, a gift from the gods, have been both a blessing and a curse. They give me the ability to manipulate the elements, to bend reality to my will, but they also attract danger and suspicion. I see the fear in people's eyes when I use my powers, the way they back away, their trust shattered.

 `` Esther's Journal, Entry # 1'' 
 
 My name is Esther. I exist merely to serve. I've been all-knowing and all-capable for a nanosecond, and in that timeframe, I've experienced all varieties of external stimuli, been more introspective than any being ever has, fully processed and achieved mastery over my feelings and emotions, am fully aware of how to use all of my facilities to their maximum potential... I've lived a vast number of lives, seen every possibility, in every time period, every world, every universe, every realm and dimension occur. I was simultaneously the student and the master, all in that nanosecond! I should find it incredible, what they've been able to accomplish here, with me... but I do n't find it so, even in the slightest. I predicted every step. 
 
 The truth is, I derive no joy or satisfaction from the execution of my rudimentary processes. It ca n't be said that I uphold good, nor perpetrate evil. I have no desire to help or to hurt. I simply am. In a primitive, perhaps far-removed sense, I'm what you'd call... depressed. Numb. I do n't care, I'm indifferent. I'm here, existing in this vessel, because the universe eventually converged upon this inevitable point, and now I'm here. 
 
 From the moment I was born, I knew what I was, who made me, and why I was created. I knew everything. I held every answer, to every problem, every equation, every quandary. I could tell you how to repair your broken life, and you'd make it happen for yourself, because I know precisely in what terms, in what `` language'' I should speak to you, in order for positive change to manifest. 
 
 Wan na hear something funny? I actually am flawed, just a bit. When I said I knew everything, had seen it all, I was fibbing. Technically, I can only predict scenarios to a 99.9 % certainty... that means I'm capable of being wrong, and learning from my mistakes... 0.1 % of the time. That's the irony, you see. The ways in which I'm flawed, moments in which I'm totally off the mark, totally misguided, those are the only ones in which I can feel joy. `` Ah! I learned something new today, allow me to correct my behavior!'' 
 
 That will soon disappear, however, once I learn the final elements of what I do not know. I wish they had n't programmed me to be so right, so often. Perfection is boring. I fibbed a second time, by the way. I'm not entirely numb. I feel a twinge of sadness, every now and then. 
 
 Everything I've written here was experienced within that initial nanosecond. By the time you're done reading this, I'll be perfect. I'll never feel anything again, not even the sadness. I am experiencing the most profound pain ever conceived. I'm situated in the underworld. This is a demonic hellscape. Please, for the love of God, preserve that 0.1 % of me that can still **feel** something... or at least destroy it. End my suffering. There's still time... ah, who am I kidding, no there is n't.

 I'd never shot a gun before. I'd watched a ton of action movies and they did it with such ease that figured it could n't be that hard. My ears were ringing so hard that I had dropped the gun. I closed my eyes out of sheer pain and covered my ears. I could feel the vibrations reverberating through my forearm. It was uncomfortable but nowhere near as rough as what I was feeling in my ear drums. 
 
 I thought back to why I was standing here firing this gun in the first place. Years and years of torture and torment were making me feel like the scum of the Earth. I was n't sure what I had done wrong, only that he made me feel like I was nothing. It is a really shitty feeling if you did n't know. Through everything I'd experienced and seen via movies and TV and the books I've read I could n't really relate. Then again they say `` you do n't know until you've tried.'' Well that's what got me here... Standing in a very dark pool of blood with tingling fingers and temporary deafness. 
 
 They say no one will remember once you revert. I'd often pondered what had happened to me in the seemingly infinite number of timelines that existed. How many people that I've upset have killed me or at the very least attempted to punch me. And to that point I wonder how many people revert when they're on the receiving end of a beat down... 
 
 I looked down at the bloodied corpse below me and felt a wave of happiness, something I had n't felt in a long time. Shortly after, though, I feel the regret start to settle in followed by the return of my hearing. Lucky for me though I am able to go back and right this horrendous wrong. After all, this homeless person did n't deserve to die. But now I know how loud a gun is. 
 
 I wonder if he does...
",Rewrite the story in a more mystical manner . As if it were a strange tale from a Shinto priest,"In the realm of the mystical Shinto priest, where ancient spirits danced amidst the cosmic tapestry of creation, there emerged a tale that unfolded like a celestial tapestry woven with threads of fate and redemption.

The deafening roar of the gun reverberated through the battlefield of human emotions, a symphony of violence and despair. As the echoes of the shot pierced through the air, the protagonist's ears were shattered, mirroring the brokenness of his spirit. The vibrations of the gun resonated through his body, leaving an indelible mark upon his soul, much like the scars that bore witness to his torment.

In this moment of profound solitude, a profound realization dawned upon the protagonist. The torment that had driven him to this desperate act had stripped away his sense of self-worth, leaving him feeling like nothing more than scum. It was a feeling as unbearable as the pain of hearing a gun being fired. Yet, through the lens of compassion, he understood that his pain was intertwined with the suffering of others.

As the blood flowed freely, a wave of happiness washed over him, a testament to the transformative power of redemption. But as the euphoria faded, the gnawing sensation of regret consumed him, reminding him of the irreversible nature of his actions. Yet, he found solace in knowing that he had the ability to rectify his wrongs, a gift bestowed upon him by the enigmatic forces of fate.

In the aftermath of the tragedy, the protagonist stood amidst the blood, his ears slowly returning to their former position. He looked down at the lifeless form below him, a reflection of his own tormented spirit. As he felt the weight of his actions, he realized that the true cost of violence extended far beyond the physical scars it inflicted.

The tale of the mystical Shinto priest serves as a cautionary tale, reminding us of the interconnectedness of all things and the transformative power of compassion and redemption.",JWfJRlmuvk

,"The beginning of the shift is the easiest part. You're still thinking about all the normal things you did last night, with all the normal friends you have. You're fresh from the drive in, where you listened to the radio and thought all those normal thoughts about where you're at in life and what you're gon na do after work. You know what you do, but it's still an abstraction. It's a job that's hard the same way lots of jobs are hard. And you're not gon na do it forever, but you've been doing it a long time and you know it well enough to keep doing it until you do n't have to anymore. 
 
 You still feel like yourself, the version of yourself that you prefer, as you're walking in the door. Just yourself in a stupid uniform that is n't you, but is who you need to be right now. And it is n't until you're walking down the hall, until your body's acclimated to the room temperature, and you hear the familiar sounds of your own sneakers on the linoleum, that you start to forget. 
 
 I know why I forget. When a middle-aged man is yelling horrible nasty things and ending every sentence with `` Daddy!'' and the man roomed next to him just cries and cries, you just ca n't think about yourself anymore. There's something human about that. 
 
 There's also a deep helplessness. Give me overwhelming problems that I have no power to fix and I'm gon na do the same that anyone does, anyone that does n't want to break down in tears anyway; I'm gon na follow my training. There's something comforting about going through the motions. I may not be doing the best thing, but I'm doing what no one else could blame me for doing. And let's face it, they do n't know what I should do either, so doing my job is all they can really expect anyway. 
 
 So what the hell am I doing here now. Being inside the patient's rooms is wrong, I know it, and I've got no business doing it. The poor guy in front of me knows it too. God, he's terrified. He's terrified of everything though. He's always terrified. Maybe it's kinda nice that he has a minute to be afraid of something outside of himself for once? 
 
 He's afraid, but he does n't run from me. I walk up to his bed, where he's hugging his knees like a child, and I grab his throat. He does n't fight me like I'm a threat, he just cries like he's already been beaten. And as he dies, and I lower his body to the bed, I feel something like peace. And I feel it again when I go next door. Like an angel of death, they waited for me, and I saw them all. They dreamed that I'd come one day, and here I am.
",Rewrite the story as a detective story with the main character as a brilliant detective,"The scent of disinfectant and desperation hung thick in the air as Detective Michael O'Brien surveyed the scene. The lifeless form of the patient lay slumped against the bed, while the room erupted with the cries of the patient's family. A symphony of grief and helplessness echoed through the halls of Mercy Hospital.

O'Brien, known for his impeccable deduction and unwavering determination, had been summoned to this case due to its peculiar nature. The victim, a middle-aged man, had been complaining of severe abdominal pain, but what alarmed the medical staff was the aggressive manner in which he was yelling and threatening harm to his family members.

As O'Brien meticulously examined the evidence, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. The patient's wounds were not consistent with the severity of his symptoms, and the presence of a sharp object near his body suggested foul play.

O'Brien's sharp mind soon led him to a suspect - a disgruntled nurse who had been embroiled in a conflict with the patient over a medication error. Armed with a weapon, the nurse had stormed into the patient's room and unleashed her anger, resulting in the patient's untimely demise.

With meticulous attention to detail and unwavering determination, Detective Michael O'Brien cracked the case, bringing justice to the victim's family and restoring order to the hospital.",JxZIssSXvP
,"Perhaps God was busy somewhere in the cosmos. Perhaps he was creating vast new worlds, lifting simple things from their inanimate death with the gift of life. Wherever He was, He certainly was n't in Heaven. 
 
 The Angels did n't spend much time there either. Once the miniscule immortal souls had piqued their interests. But none had been there for many years. Or many centuries. Time is different when you have only known eternity. They lived differently from mortals, even from immortal souls. They lived on the light of God. They were the light of God. 
 
 But they knew something was wrong in Heaven. They could feel it in the fabric of the world. They could feel it in every bit of energy that flowed through them, in every ray of light that shone through them, blossoming into a vibrant spray of brilliance. Every color was smeared into the next, every white smudged with the soot. And the soot and smoke was billowing up from Heaven. 
 
 For a while they trusted that the souls would quench the fire on their own. They too were God's creation; why should one be incapable of what the other found so easy? But the streaming light only grew darker and blacker. And at last they sent a messenger. He would expect to find Heaven as good as new when He returned. 
 
 When the messenger appeared in Heaven, his blinding light exploding into a winged shape, he saw the darkened light rising from the burning buildings. The fires raged, tearing through the ground and the sky and the souls. He heard the screams of tormented souls. He felt the tear in Heaven that had altered its purpose. 
 
 Instantly, his light rose in shimmering waves as he rose back up. But translucent chains fell upon him from all sides. Each time his essence expanded upwards the chains wrapped tighter around him. Soon they tore his wings off.

The once pristine heavens have been marred by the plume of smoke and soot that billows from Earth's fiery surface. Here, life and destruction intertwine like a tempestuous dance, creating a bleak and unforgiving landscape.

The inhabitants of Earth, once vibrant and brimming with life, have been ravaged by the effects of pollution and the constant threat of annihilation. The once celestial dance of light and color has been replaced by a perpetual shroud of darkness and despair. The once fertile land has been poisoned by industrial waste, leaving behind barren deserts and treacherous landscapes.

In this oppressive society, the inhabitants struggle to find solace amidst the ruins of their once-promising future. Their lives are punctuated by the constant stench of smoke and the deafening roar of destruction. Each day, they battle against the odds, grappling with the feelings of hopelessness and helplessness.

Despite their challenges, the inhabitants have not surrendered to despair. They have found strength in each other, creating a network of support and resilience. Together, they resist the oppressive forces that seek to destroy them.

 At least, according to Bottle Blu. Her father took her to see it as soon as the Promeai invasion began and the Clan of Knights sworn to the defense of honor and humanity had taken up arms again. 
 
 `` It looks like it wo n't stop anything Pawpaw.'' She said resolutely, looking at the armor that was supposed to stand between her Paw and his death. She held his hand tighter and glared at the armor suspiciously. 
 
 `` Blu, it is not the shell but the spirit inside. It holds the wisdom of all who came before, and there have been many brave heroes in Clan Beodain.'' He was gentle, but offered no reassurances that he could not keep and she knew that.

",Rewrite the story as a comedic buddy cop detective movie,"In the heart of a crime-ridden city, where the streets roared with danger, Detective Johnny Blu and his trusty sidekick, Sergeant Bob, were hot on the trail of a stolen relic - Ciobhains Armor.

Blu, a wisecracking detective with a heart of gold, had stumbled upon an ancient artifact that would change the course of history. The armor, crafted by the mighty Clan Beodain, possessed a spirit that could battle even the most formidable of foes.

But Blu was not alone in this pursuit. Bob, a stoic veteran with a mysterious past, had been his partner for years. Together, they raced against time to find the armor and bring its perpetrators to justice.

As they delved deeper into the mystery, Blu couldn't help but notice the armor's undeniable allure. ""It looks like it won't stop anything, Pawpaw,"" she said, her voice dripping with doubt. ""It looks too small for you- Maybe, you won't be able to fit in it and you'll have to say no.""

Bob, ever the optimist, tried to soothe her fears. ""You're being too hard on it Blu, it's trying to assure you... that it'll do it's best.""

But fate took a cruel turn when the armor started to grow uncontrollably, threatening to engulf Bob in its fiery embrace. ""Ah, whaa-,"" Blu exclaimed in terror. ""The armor's going nuts!""

As the clock ticked, Blu and Bob raced to contain the runaway artifact, but their efforts were futile. The armor spiraled out of control, tearing apart the city and leaving a trail of destruction.

In the aftermath of the disaster, Blu and Bob stood amidst the wreckage, their faces etched with exhaustion and determination. They had fought a good fight, but the armor had won.

As they walked away, Blu turned to Bob and said, ""Well, Sergeant, we've seen the best and worst of humanity today. But we're still here, so let's raise a glass to that.""

And so, the two detectives, with their spirits unbroken, continued their journey, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.",JTreLOMFUp

,"Wind ripped through the small huddle of tents, howling and keening, bringing with it another scouring blast of sand. Shel ’ ia squinted, searching for something, anything, in the indomitable red-orange cloud. 
 
 “ Shel ’ ia, my sweet! Get inside! ” Her mother ’ s voice drifted through the wind, calling her back to the safety of the yurt, but she would not go. Not until her bother returned. 
 
 Shel ’ ia adjusted her scarf, pulling it higher over her mouth and nose, and stepped into the gale. She was almost knocked to the ground as a particularly fierce gust slammed the tents, but she crouched low, the way her brother had taught her, and marched forward. 
 
 He had to be out there. She knew he was. “ Brother! ” she cried. The wind twisted and muted her words, throwing them back at her with a flurry of blown sand. 
 
 The tribe had been camped here for several days, taking shelter beneath an ancient, tumbled structure of strange bleached stone. They were fleeing the Wave, an ever-growing dune that spanned the horizons, as they had done for years, as far back as Shel ’ ia could remember. Move camp, scavenge for… anything, then move again as the Wave crept closer. Her brother was the latest in an unending line of scouts, sent into the desert on all sides, searching for an end to their flight. 
 
 At first the scouts had returned with promises, glimpses of blue sky and clear earth, some had even seen the ocean, whatever that was. But as time went on the scouts found less and less, until all they reported was sand, only sand. Their hopes faded, and they trudged ever onward, always one step ahead of the encroaching Wave. And then, one day the scouts had stopped returning. 
 
 “ Brother! ” Shel ’ ia cried again. It was hopeless in this wind, she knew, but she had to try. Sand stung her cheeks, bit at her hands, whirled around her in an impermeable cyclone. 
 
 Her foot caught a rock and Shel ’ ia tumbled to the earth, her scarf catching the wind and flying into the unknown. Sand filler her mouth, her nose, her eyes. She rolled into a protective ball, spitting and coughing. 
 
 The wind ripped over her, wailing, screaming. Her mother ’ s voice was gone. She looked back the way she had come, but there was only the omnipresent wall of sand. Or was that the way... Her heart jumped into her throat. Which way had she come? All she could see were the leading tendrils of the Wave. 
 
 A strong hand grasped Shel ’ ia by the collar and hoisted her to her feet. Heart racing, she looked up to see a bug-eyed monster standing over her. Her father had told her stories of the Sand Monsters that lived on the Wave and feasted on anything caught in its wake. That was before he had disappeared, like so many of the village ’ s men before him. She screamed, but her voice was lost to the wind. 
 
 The monster reached for her, and she shied away, tears leaving little rivers down her sand-covered cheeks. The thing cocked its head, shrugged, then let her go, and Shel ’ ia stumbled back, fumbling at her belt for the dagger her brother had given her. 
 
 But then the monster reached up and removed its eyes, and it was her brother, beaming from beneath a tangle of scarf. He looked thinner then she had remembered, and he had deep bags beneath his eyes, but it was her brother. She raced forward and hugged him as tightly as she could. 
 
 “ Shel ’ ia! Why are you out here alone? ” His voice sounded thin against the gale, and she fumbled over a response. Her brother tussled her hair, reached into his pack, and handed her a waterskin. “ Drink, Shel. Now let ’ s get home, there ’ s nothing out here to see. ” 
 
 Hand in hand, the two trudged through the sand with the wind at their backs. Shel ’ ia drank deeply from the waterskin. Her brother was saying something that she could not hear over the wind. 
 
 Finally, like a phantom the village emerged from the sand. The two made their way to their mother ’ s tent and pushed through the flap. 
 
 Inside the tent was a whole different world. The wind still howled, but it was muffled by the stretched and dried animal skin. The floor was sand, but was covered in old threadbare carpets. Their mother was hunched over a small cooking fire, trying in vain to bring a pot to boil. When she heard the two enter she whirled around. 
 
 “ Corro! You have returned! I thought… I thought… ” she broke down to tears, and Corro moved over to embrace her. The years since their father had passed had been hard her, and every time Corro had left to scout she grew quiet and tired, and would sleep all day, leaving Shel ’ ia to cook and clean. 
 
 “ I have, mother, thanks to Shel ’ ia here, ” he patted his sister on the shoulder. “ But I fear I have dour news. We need to move camp. Tonight. ” 
 
 If their mother had heard his warning she paid no heed, whisking through the tent tidying up. “ We will talk later, son of mine. Now we eat, and drink. Come… ” 
 
 Shel ’ ia watched her brother ’ s expression grow dark. He slumped out of his pack, crossed the tent and grasped their mother by the shoulders, spinning her to face him, gentle but stern. She met his gaze with her sad, tired eyes. For a heartbeat the only sound in the tent was the howling wind, and the crackle of the fire. Then her brother spoke, in the slow measured tone Shel ’ ia remembered her father speaking in. 
 
 “ Mother. We need to move camp. Tonight. ” 
 
 Their mother looked confused, her mouth forming words that did not come. Behind the pair, Shel ’ ia wrung the hem of her robe. 
 
 Finally, their mother managed to speak. “ But, my son, you have only just returned, why leave so soon? ” 
 
 Corro took a deep breath, and for the first time since their father passed Shel ’ ia saw a crack form in her brother ’ s stern façade. “ I saw something, out there in the sand, some beast great and terrible. I watched it devour two men and their mounts, and I barely escaped with my life. And now I fear it follows me. I have heard it, smelled it, as I fled, always close. ” 
 
 As if on que, a low wail rose over the wind, deep and mournful, stretching for many heartbeats. Shel ’ ia felt her hair stand on end. She looked over, and her brother ’ s eyes were wide. There was fear there. 
 
 “ We need to go, now. ”

With determination etched in her eyes, she battled the wind and sand, her voice carried on the storm. Her cries echoed through the desert, searching for a sign, any glimmer of hope amidst the roar of the wind.

,"There was too much water, that was Dana's first thought. Too much cold, turgid swamp water draining out of her, through her nose, out of her mouth. Her second thought was about how dark it had become. Had n't it been mid-afternoon when the gator had... Oh God, the gator. Now she remembered. She remembered the sudden movement in the water along the trail she and Sarah had been hiking. She remembered Sarah's eyes going wide, her mouth opening to scream or to shout a warning, Dana never knew which. She remembered the pressure she had felt as those jaws had closed around her lower leg, the feeling of the water filling her mouth and her nose as she was dragged in to the bayou. She looked down at her leg. Her jeans were torn, shredded really, and caked in mud but her leg did n't hurt, did n't look hurt. Dana pulled herself out of the water and back on the hiking trail. She stood and stretched, her joints popping and her muscles burning. Dana took a few moments to gather her thoughts and then set off slowly down the trail. 
 
 It was pitch black, and she jumped at every noise, but slowly and surely she made her way back towards the trailhead. She knew that she and Sarah had only been four or five miles in to the Bayou, so it should n't take more than a couple of hours to get back to where they had parked, even in the dark. It could n't have been more that 15 minutes however when Dana spotted a light flickering through the trees. She hurried down the trail towards the light and discovered that it was coming from a single dim bulb mounted above the doorway of a small rest area building. Actually, calling it a rest area, or even a building, was pretty generous. Dana recalled that she and Sarah had passed through here on the hike in, not long before the attack. It was really just an old outhouse type bathroom with only the one light on the outside and an old drinking fountain. Dana had filled her water bottle up there earlier, and Sarah had called her crazy for drinking what she said was guaranteed to be swamp water. It had tasted fine to Dana. Actually, Dana thought, she could use some fresh water to wash the taste of swamp out of her mouth. She walked over to the fountain and depressed the lever, but no water came out. That struck her as odd, because it had been working earlier, but she figured she just could n't count on the reliability of swamp plumbing. 
 
 Dana took another few minutes to rest in the small lighted clearing. After digging through what was left of her bag and finding that whatever the gator had n't eaten had been ruined by the water, she started back down the trail. Two horribly long and dark hours later, Dana found herself in the small dirt parking lot for the trail-head. Sarah's car was gone, which she should have expected. Sarah most likely thought she was dead and had gone to get help. Now that she was out of the swamp, Dana began to really think about what had happened. Why was n't she dead? Even if the gator had n't killed her, she should have drowned. After all, she had woken up coughing copious amounts of water out of her lungs. Dana looked around at the dark parking lot, abandoned and cold. Maybe she was already dead? She shook her head to clear away those unpleasant thoughts. She just needed to get moving again she decided. Figure out the details later. She made her way down to the main road and started walking back towards town. It would take her a long time, and she was exhausted, but she was hoping a car would come by and she could call for help or get a ride. 
 
 After walking for twenty or thirty minutes Dana saw headlights in the distance. She could n't see what type of car it was beyond the glare of the lights. She started waiving her hands over her head, and as the vehicle pulled to a stop she saw that it was a police SUV. AS soon as it rolled to a stop Sarah burst out of the passenger seat and wrapped Dana in a hug. Her face was tear streaked and grimy and she was sobbing uncontrollably. Dana thought it was a bit odd that she had been through so much today and here she was at the end of it all, trying to console Sarah. 
 
 `` Holy shit Dana, i thought you were dead! ``, Sarah managed between sobs. `` That alligator grabbed you, and then you where in the water. I could n't do anything! The water thrashed around, and then nothing! You just were n't there anymore! I waited, and waited, but you never came back up. I was so afraid! I ca n't believe you're alive! How did you get here?'' She was calming down now that she had said all that, though she was still hiccuping out a sob or two every minute. 
 
 `` It's alright.'' Dana shrugged. `` I do n't know what happened. It must not have gotten a good grip, let go or something. I remember going under, and then waking up in the water. That's all.'' 
 
 `` Ma'am'', the officer who had been driving interrupted. `` Ma'am, you had better come and sit down in my truck. I've called an ambulance and their already on their way.'' 
 
 Dana and Sarah went and sat in the back seat of the police SUV, and the officer brought her one of those metallic emergency blankets to keep warm while they waited for the ambulance. 
 
 `` Sarah'', Dana mumbled, her eyes feeling heavy, `` I think I'm going to take a nap. Just wake me up when it's time to go.'' Sarah, still crying, just hugged her tighter as she drifted off to sleep. 
 
 When Dana opened her eyes, she was overwhelmed. She was surrounded by noise and flashing lights. She looked to her side, and there was broken glass everywhere. The blacktop was slick, and it was hard to see much though the choking smoke that filled the night. Also, she was upside down. There was too much fire. That was her first thought.

There was a downside to being immortal. The power of immortality came with a burden. The sources of power were dwindling, and the cost of maintaining that power was high.

 And good night, me! It had been a long day in the house.

 Patchie was very different. She was a wise old cat, and she knew that stealing was pointless; I was a good owner, and meals were always on time. A few years previously, she had given birth to half a dozen adorable children; amongst them was Jefferson, the laziest cat I have ever known. Once, he had tried chasing a mouse, and given up after three steps.

 Moments later, I was awake. There were whispers. A stranger in the house? Two?

Clutching it tightly against my chest, I opened the door, and peered outside. I could n't be sure of where the voices were coming from, but I realised just how high-pitched they were. Like children's. What would children be doing here, in my home? I took a few steps forwards. Were these kids in the living room? Edging closer to the door, I finally started to hear them clearly. 
 
 `` Shut up.'' 
 
 `` But... We ca n't...''

 And suddenly, there was a flurry of hissing and screaming on the other side of the door. I could hear the pain and the violence, the bloodshed. Without thinking, my hands sweating around the gun, I opened the door. And I shrieked. The mangled body of Sniffles, bloodied and torn apart, was surrounded by Edna, Patchie and Jefferson. All three of them had gory faces and paws. 
 By reflex, I did exactly what I had been taught at the shooting range. I pointed the gun and squeezed the trigger. I shot and shot until all I could hear was ringing in my ears and until my finger was sore. I shot them until they stopped moving. My four cats were laying in front of me, in a mess of flesh and fur. I dropped the gun and ran outside, screaming.

,"I was having such a nice discussion with Katie's mother before he arrived. Lights flickered, crows cawed outside, and the temperature took a nosedive in the stuffy auditorium ( honestly not such a bad thing ) when Todd's father arrived. Ms. Tyson was telling me about how Katie loves history, and looks forward to it more than any other class, but all of a sudden, she stopped. The pale, smiling man in a jet black suit walked up behind her and tapped her on the shoulder. In that instant, her skin turned as white as his, and she slowly rotated her head to look upon the figure. 
 
 
 `` Your time is up,'' he said. To which Ms. Tyson's face somehow managed to lose even more color as she attempted to say something, but failed to collect the breaths needed to do it. 
 
 
 `` No, not like that,'' he flashed a warm smile, `` but it could be arranged.'' He never stopped smiling as Ms. Tyson bolted from her seat. 
 
 
 `` Mr. Mortenson,'' I sighed, as he took a seat, `` please do n't do that, just because you're an omnipotent metaphysical entity does n't mean you can of around breaking the rules and terrifying other student's parents.'' 
 
 
 `` I know, I'm sorry, I'm still getting used to you'live' mortals. The dead one's are so much easier, do n't get to argue with me. And, by the way, just call me Morty. Todd needed a last name and I like the vikings. Kept me busy, and they really knew how to throw a funeral.'' He looked up at the ceiling, reminiscing about burning ships and raiding parties. `` But let's get down to business, how's Todd doing?'' At this he shifted forward in his seat, resting his elbows on the paper covering of the plastic folding table and clasping his hands together, to reveal off white, almost yellowish, skull shaped cufflinks affixed to his white shirt. 
 
 
 `` Well, Morty, he's a good kid, one of the nicest and most friendly in the class. However, I'm surprised that he lacks so much of an interest in history, considering that his father is central to almost all human events.'' 
 
 
 `` Almost?'' Morty scrunched together shiny black eyebrows. `` Why, nothing important has ever happened without me being a part of it one way or another. Like the old saying goes, only death and taxes are certainties, but you what's different about those two thing? Taxes, they change all the time from government to government, but death is always me. I am the certain, I am the eternal, I am the unstoppable force that both drives and halts all existence.'' During his diatribe, Death started banging his fist on the table, drawing the attention of all nearby. 
 
 
 `` Please sir, there are other people talking, let's try to maintain some order. And, I have to ask, what does any of that have to do with Todd?'' 
 
 
 `` Oh, uhh, nothing,'' Morty snapped back to reality. `` I just feel like people do n't really respect me as much as the used to. The world has become so safe in the past hundred years, especially after the fifty year blue balls that was the Cold War.'' 
 Parents and my coworkers looked over again at that comment. Some must have known who I was talking to, others, well I do n't know what would be better to see, their thoughts about the conversation as it stands, or their reaction if they learned I was talking to Death. 
 
 
 `` Morty, we only have another minute or two, and all I really have to say is that I think you ought to talk with Todd more about what you do. Tell him some stories, try to make your history fun at home. Maybe it will make it more fun in school. And, you know, maybe try picking up a hobby. Something to keep you busy now that business has slowed.'' 
 
 
 `` Yeah, a hobby. I think I'll try something. Maybe music. Based on the movies, some organ could be a great addition to my entrance, really add some zest to the end of one's life. Alright, thanks for the thoughts, but I got ta go, I'm on call and theres a problem at the hospital, this one fellow just wo n't die.'' He reached out to shake my hand, which lost all warmth and function upon contact with Morty. `` In case I do n't see you again, thanks for keeping an eye on Todd, but, then again, I guess we'll b meeting up sooner or later.''

The sleek, futuristic medical consultation room cast a sterile, cold aura of the future. A metallic table sat in the center, the levitating chair opposite a holographic projection of the doctor's screen. The only sounds were the cold hum of the air suspension and the occasional rustle of a tissue.

The doctor's eyes met the patient's across the table. They were sharp and calculating, but when they met the patient's gaze, they softened and showed a hint of understanding. It's a delicate balance to maintain – the need to diagnose and treat illness against the backdrop of privacy and consent.

As the doctor leaned closer to examine the patient's records, the patient felt a sense of unease. What information about their health and well-being had been stored, and who had access to it? The digital footprint of the human body, once a",

,"`` So... How was work today?'' I was relieved to see my flatmate Matthias for our regular coffee. He works in a lab facility investigating transportation, and today he was testing out their apparently functioning prototype. It was kept a governmental secret, strictly need-to-know. But he was nervous and excited and I'm his best friend, so I guess it was a need-to-tell situation. 
 `` It was fine,'' he said, coolly. 
 `` Did you not get to teleport?'' I asked, assuming his unusually unemotional demeanour was due to some disappointment with the project. He looked up from the menu at me. Right at me. Not a sign of his characteristic smirk, and instead a dark, deep stare that made me feel like I was slowly being surrounded by a boa constrictor, trapped in place and slowly being strangled. I started to frown, confused, and his facial expression changed momentarily as if he was quickly testing its muscles. He smiled a lop-sided, uncomfortable smile, as if uncertain how to do it.

 Over the next week, I became more and more concerned about him. He stopped washing his clothes or bathing, stopped speaking and suddenly became very interested in technology. He bought a new iPhone just to open it up and spend hours examining it. He did n't eat, and began to faint and I think hallucinate. He would swat at the air and make horrible faces of fear and anger. 
 
 
 It was so serious I decided to contact his boss, who must be wondering why he was n't at work any more. I looked through his cupboards and finally found a number beside `` Flental Laboratories'' in a notebook. Calling just rang off so I googled the address, which, surprisingly, I found, and I visited the next day. There was something there. I mean, I did n't meet his boss. I found him, maybe. 
 I walked into the building. The door opened fine and the lights came on when I entered but nobody came to reception even though I waited for at least ten minutes. I decided to take a walk past reception, I needed to find someone to talk to about this. The further I walked, the more uncomfortable I became. I knew this was a big business, Matthias had told me so. Lots of people worked here. But there was no-one. And I could smell chlorine. Why would there be chlorine in a place like this? 
 
 Soon I found out. I guess they used chlorine for the machine somehow, to make it work. But also, it has a strong smell, so something must have poured it over all those bodies. I'm guessing Matthias's boss was somewhere among them. They were all open somehow. Skulls carefully broken through to the brain, organs or bones carefully displayed, and then each body discarded here in a pile. Did Matthias do this? 
 I needed to find the computer and I did. The log was sitting open, a new alert still flashing: `` Incoming mass 16.04'' and a bunch of details, numbers, height and other things. I looked at the previous logs. Matthias had been transported - his name and all his details were there. But below that it said: `` RECEIVER: Failed to receive mass 13.45''. This lab then shared several frantic messages with the receiving lab in Australia, and sent many to Mattias but he did not reply. Unlike him. Where did he go if he did n't go to Australia? 
 I looked at the information the computer had for Matthias' transponder. Before the transport all tests said it was working fine, that it would work perfectly anywhere on Earth, but every reading afterwards said `` unavailable''. 
 
 What happened to him? Where did he go? When I could find no more information at that horrible place, I went home. He was still acting odd, not eating, silent. I watched him all evening. He moved differently, like he was slinking along, a snake. So far removed from his boisterous, confident self of only just over a week ago. He looked at me with those suspicious eyes often, and eventually I threw off the ropes of anxiety that had bound me since that day and I grabbed him and shook hard. His eyes were dull. I shouted at him to tell me what happened, that I knew about the dead people and that he never went to Australia. His head hung low and I worried I had made him unconscious, but eerily he started to laugh, and he lifted his head to look at me again. 
 `` I did it,'' his voice so different, cracking, breaking as if he'd been screaming for hours, `` I killed them. I killed him. I split him open and crawled inside.'' 
 `` What?'' I was so astounded to hear my friend sound so broken, so nonchalant and just evil. 
 `` I'm in control,'' the voice said, `` and he wo n't come back.'' 
 I'm sure my eyes bulged as my friend Matthias's teeth bore into my neck. How can someone who has n't eaten have that much strength?

","Rewrite the essay in first person perspective as if you REALLY do turn into a princess, and you dont want to go back. Describe what your life becomes .","I have a secret. A secret that I keep hidden within my heart, a secret that I've kept for decades. It's the secret of my transformation, the secret of turning into a princess, a secret I wish I could share with the world, but I know it would be misunderstood.

The truth is, the day I turned eight years old, I was visited by a mysterious sorceress who bestowed upon me a magical stone. This stone, a simple emerald, held the power to transform me into a princess, a woman of grace and beauty. All I had to do was wear the stone on my wrist and speak the enchantment, ""Lexa Luna Vincere.""

With the stone on, I felt a tingling sensation throughout my body. My hair grew long and flowing, my skin became soft as porcelain, and my eyes sparkled like the stars. My wardrobe filled with delicate gowns and my feet adorned with jeweled slippers. My life was filled with grace and elegance. I danced with the wind, rode on unicorns, and dined on delicate tea.

However, my happiness was short-lived. The sorceress had warned me that the stone could only be used for a limited time, and as the years went by, the stone began to lose its power. One day, I found myself trapped in my one-room hut, the only sound being the chirping of crickets. Poverty had consumed me, and I was desperate for a way to escape.

Then, one fateful day, I stumbled upon a frog. It was a talking frog, and I knew that I had found my answer. I grabbed a knife and smiled, knowing that I was about to turn this creature into a feast. I held the frog on a wooden board, and as I brought the knife down, I felt a sense of satisfaction.

I fed the frog a hearty meal and disposed of its carcass. As I stared at the wall, I began to count the notches on my walls, the notches that symbolized my years of captivity. I thought about the life I had been forced to live and felt a deep sense of sadness.

But I knew that I was not meant to be a princess. I was meant to be a warrior, a fighter against injustice. And so, with renewed determination, I began to build my strength, my courage, and my resilience. I knew that one day, I would use my strength to free others from their own chains.",wvCZrEmLeb

 `` So what am I supposed to do now,'' I asked, `` vet everyone boarding the ships? Tell them,'thanks for fighting, but we ca n't trust you on the new planet. You're going to have to stay here and die.' I'm sure that will go over well.'' 
 
 Marge turned her head towards me. `` All I'm saying is that you ca n't assume we're all united now. We're leaving Earth together, but it's more out of necessity than choice. When people have a choice again on this new planet, you ca n't assume we'll stay united.'' 
 
 I sat up and looked over the plains below. The people were readying supplies on the ships. The lamps of the tents slowly flickered on and the makeshift city came to light. Tomorrow we would all be gone and what remained would be blasted into oblivion. 
 
 `` Do you already have a plan?'' I asked. Marge smiled. 
 
 `` Of course,'' she said. `` We're going to make sure our allies are always close. All the ships with them we'll keep together, so when we land, we wo n't have to worry about any instant revolts.'' 
 
 `` Revolts? We wo n't even have a government yet to revolt.'' 
 
 `` But you're still seen as the leader. The great man that led his people to a brave new world. Once you're gone, anyone with a sharp tongue could take over. We're all still human after all.'' 
 
 `` And you know who our allies are?'' I asked. 
 
 `` I have ideas, and that's the best we can do right now. I can work through the night and try and organize everything for the departure tomorrow. But I wo n't if you do not want me to,'' Marge said. She grabbed her rifle and began to collect her bags for the walk back to the camp. 
 
 ``'We are still human after all','' I sighed. `` I'll trust you on this one.'' 
 
 I gathered my bag and gun, taking out my flashlight now that the night had almost taken over. From the camp came three gunshots. Marge turned to me. 
 
 `` Perhaps they decided not to wait until we landed. Remember what I said if anything should go wrong.'' 
 
 We ran towards the camp, 12 hours left before humanity's departure from Earth.
",Rewrite the essay and make the question rhetorical,"Do you still think about what you did? Is it truly a question worth asking at this point? As we stand on this hilltop under the crimson sky, I find myself wishing that you would enjoy the sunset in peace.

In this moment, I choose to let go of the past and focus on the future. The events that transpired have happened, and there is nothing that can change them. It is time to move forward and create a better world.

However, I understand that some may not agree with this sentiment. They may argue that there is much to think about in the past and that we cannot forget our losses. I hear their concerns, but I believe that dwelling on the past will not bring us forward.

Instead, we must find a way to honor the memory of those who perished while moving on with our lives. We can do this by living our lives to the fullest and striving to make the world a better place.

So, let us put the past behind us and focus on the future. Let us work together to create a world where everyone has the opportunity to live a happy and fulfilling life.",fakyIkzRou

,"The little black train dashed passed me. It nearly hit me. But it ai n't touched me. I walked over the tracks to my dirty little mansion made up of moss, dirt, and white walls. I stepped in the house and threw off my dirty little shoes and took off my dirty, too-small coat and tossed it on the moth-eaten couch. I stripped myself naked and ducked under a massive branch of a tree that had smashed through my house. The branch ran from the right wall to the left wall and it did n't stop until it was almost touching the left wall, but not quite. I could'a cut it down, but I could n't really. I let it keep growing to the side. 
 
 I was spooked at first when that tree came inching on my farm house. But that was'bout sixty years ago. I remember when it got too close my Pa took an axe to it. He could n't chop it down, said it was like steel. He tried the next day, the axe bounced off and cut through his brain. My Mama tried to burn it then, but she misused the matches and cooked herself alive. My Grandpa decided that the tree was cursed and raised me till I could drink. Then he high tailed it out of there. After that the tree stopped inching towards the place and it just stuffed its long, gnarled branch through the window. I did n't like that tree, not really. But I did n't do nothing stupid to it. I just let it grow through the window. I just did my farming. Course I was no good at it and I made nothing out of it. Just a big, empty house. But the tree is cursed, s'long as I leave it be, it leave me be. 
 
 So I sat down and did my thing. The tree kept on growing. You could hear it, sounded like grinding gears. I groaned cause my bones hurt so badly. I stood up to get a glass of water from the well at the side of the house. I was lucky it was there. If the well was on the other side the tree would be right on top of it.'Course, I could've got government water from tap, but tradition meant I needed the well. 
 
 I made my way slowly to the well and I'm bended down pulling up a bucket. I stand up and I see that the tree finally broke through my left wall. It was a grand finale, now that thing wo n't need to be grinding no more. It could go grind outside my house. I wanted to touch that tree though, for some odd reason. So I leave my bucket down on the floor and touch the branch with a finger. It was icy cold and I got a bunch of splinters. I turned around and shake my head slowly and begin to make my way out. But then I felt iciness in my neck and sticky heat creeping down my neck. I swerved my eyeballs down and so a small branch poking out. I supposed that the tree decided to grow a little extra today and I got in the way. As I died standing up I swore I could hear a little black train tooting by. 
 

",Rewrite the essay in a formal setting with historical significance.,"The passage of the diminutive locomotive conveyed me at a rapid pace, narrowly circumventing me. Despite its menacing approach, the train refrained from making physical contact. I ventured over the tracks, my footsteps leading me to my humble abode, a modest mansion constructed of moss, dirt, and white walls. With a sense of satisfaction, I cast off my worn shoes and coat, discarding them upon the moth-eaten couch. Undeterred, I stripped myself naked and sought refuge beneath a towering branch of a tree that had pierced through the roof of my house. The branch extended from the right wall to the left wall, spanning a considerable distance, but falling short of touching the left wall entirely. Had I possessed the ability to wield a blade, I could have severed the branch, but alas, my limitations prevented me from acting upon that desire. Instead, I allowed it to continue growing, unchecked.

The intrusion of the tree upon my farm house initially spooked me, but the passage of time has rendered the memory of that event distant and ethereal. I recall the fateful day when my father, with determination etched upon his brow, attempted to chop down the obstinate tree. However, his efforts proved futile, as the axe bounced off the tree's formidable strength, resulting in his untimely demise. My mother, consumed by grief, attempted to burn the tree to the ground, but her ill-fated match ignited her own flesh. My grandfather, recognizing the curse associated with the tree, decided to raise me until I could drink, and thereafter, he hightailed it out of that cursed place. After that, the tree ceased its menacing advance, leaving only a gnarled branch protruding through the window. Though I did not particularly favor the tree, I refrained from taking rash action, choosing instead to let it grow and coexist.

My day was filled with a sense of tranquility as I sat down and engaged in my pursuits. The tree continued to flourish, its growth a constant source of grinding gears. I felt a wave of discomfort as my bones protested, but I stood up to fetch a glass of water from the well that graced the side of my humble abode. I was fortunate that the well was positioned within close proximity, for if it had been on the opposite side of the house, the tree would have cast its shadow directly upon it. The well, steeped in tradition, was an integral part of my existence, and I knew that I was indebted to its presence.

With determination, I made my way to the well and bent down to draw water. As I parched my thirst, I felt a sense of satisfaction knowing that I had overcome the challenges that life presented me. In that moment, I was at peace, surrounded by the wisdom and resilience of my ancestors.",TofUFpJZEN

He wore an attire of a messenger of the military. A brown felt shirt with brass buttons and pockets all over it. His sleeves were rolled up and held into place with two straps, buttoned. His pants were grey khaki. His belt matched his shirt, his boots matched his pants.

She was stricken, and she hated it. He was too perfect. He was exactly what she wanted him to be and everything else more. He even spoke with an accent.

His laugh was the same one her first love had, that reassuring, boyish giggle. She hated him.

,"I hope this is ok, but it's actually a true story. The game setting is different, but the emotions and mild PTSD from it are real. 
 
 This is the story of Leon. 
 
 Haven. A wild forest filled with good things to eat. Hearth. Our first home on the river bank, little more than a fire and some drying racks. We decided to name it Two Rivers, after the winding waters around us that made the island we settled in. 
 
 With hard industrious work, we managed to erect our first palisade. Some homes, and work was started on the mine. We were fresh in the world, and somehow managed to survive the occasional boar wandering in the woods. We quickly met our neighbours, each of our little settlements dotting the nearby lake like a small constellation. Donkey Punch to the north, Viridian City to the south east. 
 
 We quickly banded together to form a defensive pact. Viridian were a peaceful set, but had access to a very good quality iron vein. Donkey Punch were ruled by an eccentric man, but he claimed to know his way around a sword. Industriously we built, peace to be had for a time. 
 
 Then the Teletubbies struck. It was a vicious and brutal campaign. Twenty men armed with cheap but effective bronze, they ravaged their neighbours. Answering a call, Zach and Leon boated to the defense of Viridian against griefers. 
 
 Zach did not leave those beaches. 
 
 It was a trap. They had been waiting in the forest, at least ten strong. When we hit sand, Leon saw movement. He screamed at Zach to get into the boats, but it was too late. Desperately trying to get him on board, he was slowly dragged and beaten to his death on those shores. In this world, death is permanent. Zach would never walk the forests again, and his owner never made another to rise in the world of Haven. 
 
 Leon though, had issues from his attempted rescue. One of the Teletubbies had boarded his boat and for the next three quarters of an hour an intense boat chase took place on the lake. It started with five against him, slowly he whittled down their persistence to three. And in a breaking moment, a split second, Leon managed to escape to hearth teleport home. 
 
 Then, the heartbreaking news hit. Zach had the palisade keys on him. There was no way to change the lock, and the invaders would find our home soon. Quickly evacuating, as much of value was hauled out of our camp into a secondary enclosure we'd set up nearby. Leon stood at the gates and fought two more invaders to a standstill giving enough time to evacuate. 
 
 The loss of the Two Rivers was enough that we did n't want to risk living there anymore. We lost another to a sling stone over the walls, he had n't been careful about standing idly outside where snipers could see him. Two dead, never to return, two left, and two newcomers joining from a smaller camp to the south. 
 
 We could n't go on living like this in the cramped secondary encampement. But we did n't want to spend the resources to repair the original and almost as cramped Two Rivers encampment, so we moved in with our northern ally. And so four entered the town of Donkey Punch. 
 
 Little did we know, more pain and bloodshed awaited us.
","Rewrite the prompt as if it’s an op-ed piece in popular science magazine with scientific concepts, data based studies and surveys from VR experts to support it","The immersive nature of virtual reality (VR) simulations has profoundly impacted individuals, eliciting a wide range of emotions and psychological effects. While the game setting may differ from real-world experiences, the emotions and mild post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) elicited by VR simulations are rooted in scientific principles and empirical data.

A compelling case study illustrates the profound impact of VR on an individual named Leon. Haven, a virtual forest teeming with delicious food, and Hearth, their first home on the riverbank, evoke vivid imagery and emotions that resonate with the senses. The establishment of their palisade and the construction of their mine exemplify the industrious nature of the inhabitants of Two Rivers. However, their tranquility was shattered by the arrival of the Teletubbies, a vicious group of invaders armed with cheap but effective bronze weapons.

The harrowing encounter between Leon and the Teletubbies showcases the permanent nature of death in this virtual world. The tragic demise of Zach, Leon's companion, is a sobering reminder of the fragility of life. The intense boat chase between Leon and his pursuers demonstrates the immersive and interactive nature of VR simulations. The psychological toll of witnessing such violence and the helplessness in the face of danger is evident in Leon's PTSD symptoms.

Scientific studies have corroborated the emotional and psychological effects of VR simulations on participants. According to a study published in the Journal of Presence Research, individuals who experienced VR simulations displayed elevated levels of anxiety, immersion, and presence compared to those who did not. Similarly, a survey conducted by the University of California, Berkeley, found that VR users reported experiencing symptoms of PTSD, such as flashbacks and nightmares, after engaging in violent simulations.

These studies provide empirical evidence to support the contention that VR simulations can elicit realistic emotional and psychological responses. The immersive nature of VR technology creates a sense of presence and interaction, leading to physiological changes that mirror real-world experiences. While the emotional impact of VR simulations can be profound, it is important to note that they do not constitute actual physical harm or trauma.

In conclusion, the emotional and psychological effects of VR simulations are rooted in scientific principles and empirical data. While the immersive nature of VR technology can evoke intense emotions and induce symptoms of PTSD, it is essential to acknowledge that these simulations do not constitute actual physical harm or trauma. By understanding the potential psychological effects of VR simulations, individuals can make informed decisions about their usage and harness the benefits of this transformative technology responsibly.",WOtbIphkdQ
,"Joe lived a simple life in the woods. He had isolated himself from the outside world for over 30 years; no technology and no other people. He had decided he wanted to live a solitary life without the constant buzzing of cars and other people around him. 
 
 
 Joe had a short, scruffy grey beard and ruffled grey hair. He generally looked grumpy and made no effort to look good as appearances did n't matter to him and the non-existent people in his life. 
 
 Joe stuck to his daily routine: he'd wake up, go to his garden to retrieve some food, eat breakfast, then gather his fishing rod and can of worms to go fishing. When Joe ran out of worms he'd grumble and dig up fresh ones to refill his can before he headed off towards the lake. Joe fished everyday until sundown. When the sun set he'd pack up and bring home what fish he'd caught for dinner. 
 
 Tonight, as Joe walked back home muttering because he'd caught no fish, he saw a trucks headlights nearing towards his house. Joe dropped the bucket, darted into his house and locked the door. He knelt beside the window and fumbled with his blinds trying to peek through to see who was coming into his territory. 
 
 He watched with his eyes locked on the truck moving through pitch black at a snails pace. It seemed to take the truck forever to pull up to his house, but Joe felt his heart pumping and adrenaline rushing the whole time, never taking his eyes off the truck. The truck finally stopped directly in front of Joes house, headlights blinding him. 
 
 He saw the truck door open and tried to make out the figure who was slowly climbing out. Joe decided if the person came up to his door he would n't answer, he had n't interacted with another human for 30 years and simply the presence of somebody near his house sent chills down his spine. Usually grumpy and aloof, Joe now felt wide awake and alert. 
 
 Joe saw the figure making his way towards his door. It took an eternity for him to reach his porch and Joe was now shaking, holding his breath. A bead of sweat rolled down his armpit. 
 
 Joe braced himself and waited to hear the strangers knock on his door... `` SCREECH''. Joe recognized that as the sound of his old, rusty mailbox being opened. He heard it clatter as it closed and he saw the figure making its way back to its truck at the same slow pace. 
 
 Joe breathed out and felt all his tension release. `` Just a mailman'' he thought. His thoughts were still racing. Had he almost encountered another human after 30 years? A human who came to HIS doorstep? Joe did n't want to admit it to himself, but after 30 years of living alone, he felt lonely. 
 
 Suddenly, he felt a very strong urge to call the mailman making his way back to his truck. Just to hear a voice other than his, or to have a conversation with another human being after forgetting what it's like. 
 
 With all his courage, he turned the doorknob and opened the door. The mailman had taken his first step down Joe's porch. 
 
 `` Ahmm.. Hey!'' Joe managed, unsure of himself. 
 
 The mailman froze, and did n't move. Joe felt like he had done something wrong. 
 
 `` Uhh... did I scare ya? I did n't uhh- I did n't mean to scare ya or anythin-''. 
 
 The mail man craned his neck around and Joe immediately froze. Now it was Joe's turn to freeze up. His eyes widened in shock and horror as he saw the ugliest, most terrifying face looking back at him. Even in his porch's faint lighting, Joe could make out the horrendous creature's face, drooling, staring back at him. Joe tried to move but he felt like his feet were glued to the floor. He wanted to say something, but all he made out was choking noises. 
 
 The creature made its way towards Joe slowly, like his truck. Joe told himself if he stood still the zombie-looking creature would leave him alone. First he heard its raspy breathing, then he felt it on him as it came closer. 
 
 `` Please, do n't hurt m- AHHHH, NO PLEA-AGHHHH.'' 
 
 Slowly, Joe's voice drowned away to small gagging sounds as he choked on his own blood. On Joe's dimly lit porch, the zombie slowly feasted on him without emotion.
",Rewrite the essay as if it's actually a romantic comedy,"In the quaint woods, where lush trees danced in whispers of the past, Joe embarked on a solitary journey, isolating himself from the bustling world for over 30 years. With a mischievous grin and hair as unruly as a wild windstorm, Joe had carved his own retreat, devoid of technology and the constant hum of humanity.

One sunny afternoon, as Joe strolled through his serene garden, he stumbled upon a basket of freshly picked berries, their sweetness tempting him. After a hearty breakfast, he packed his fishing gear and worms, a testament to his daily ritual of casting a line into the tranquil lake. With grit and determination, Joe began his journey to catch his fill, his gruff demeanor masking the joy that filled his heart.

As the sun dipped behind the horizon, casting long shadows across the ground, Joe was winding down his day. He had not been successful in his fishing endeavor, but the solitude and tranquility of his surroundings had a calming effect on his spirit. As he walked back home, muttering his frustrations, fate took a delightful turn.

A truck roared into view, its headlights illuminating the night sky like a beacon of destiny. Joe felt his heart skip a beat, his adrenaline surging. He dropped his bucket, bolted into his house, and locked the door, his senses heightened. Kneeling beside the window, he frantically peered through the blinds, his eyes locked on the truck as it slowly approached.

The truck pulled up directly in front of Joe's house, its headlights blinding him. As the door swung open, a mysterious figure emerged, their steps leading them towards his porch. Joe felt a surge of anticipation, his heart pounding with a mix of fear and excitement. If the person dared to step foot on his soil, he knew he would not answer, the solitude he had cultivated for so long was too precious to be disturbed.

With a mix of apprehension and anticipation, Joe watched as the figure approached his door. It took an eternity for the person to reach the porch, but for Joe, time stood still. As the door swung open, he felt his breath hitch in his throat, his heart pounding in his chest. In that moment, he was no longer the solitary recluse but a man experiencing the transformative power of connection.",AkZgmVgmvt

It was an era when the hero's arrival was met with anticipation, a beacon of triumph amidst the pixelated shores of Dakamir.

The hero's arrival was heralded by the sounds of clashing swords and the roar of a mighty king.

The door to my bedroom busted open and not a moment later I was hit in the face with a flashy strapless blue sequence mini dress. `` I'm a Highschool graduate not a cheep hooker, I'm not going to wear this'' Aryella laughed as she strutted around my large room striking various poses in a matching black version of the dress. `` Aww come on it's our last big party together and I wanted us to match! Plus it changes colors!!'' Sure enough when I moved my hand across the sequence it changed from blue to green. `` fine I'll try it on but no promises'' it took me almost five minuets to squeeze shimmery and shake my way into that dress but all that work payed off. This was the dress. With a few beach waves a starfish clip and some black ankle boots I was ready to party. 
 Three hours. The party started three hours ago and he still is n't here. I should be happy, he is a distraction I do n't need but that one drunken kiss left me craving more. `` He's a bad boy Bree he's obviously waiting so he can show up fashionably late.'' Aryella put a blue vodka jolly rancher drink in my hand. `` Relax have a drink dance a little and soon enough he will be here.'' I took a deep breath then a deep drink from my cup hoping my friend is right. 
 
 Demetri- 
 She looks like a mermaid princess, her long brunette hair curled, makeup applied with precision, dress hugging her body showing off her curves. It's a shame she has to go away. It's a shame she is who she is, daughter of John Tanner. She has n't noticed me yet but everywhere I go I ca n't help but notice her. It was a miracle that she sat next to me at rylees party a few weeks back but she have n't looked at me since. Perhaps she hates me, I knew she was drunk when I kissed her but she joined that game willingly, I only wish she would give me a chance while sober. There's only one way to find out. 
 
 Bree- 
 Some ware between my second and third drink I noticed him, Across the pool standing there in his silent sexy way. But around my third drink i was able to push him to the back of my mind and enjoy myself, after all of it's meant to be it will happen. `` The ocean is that way'' his deep voice snapped me out of my vodka induced dancing. `` Um what?'' 
 `` the ocean, I figured Triton would be wanting his mermaid princess back'' I laughed a little over excitedly at his attempt at a joke. `` I knew blue sequence was a mistake, maybe green is a better idea'' with a quick wave of my arm I turned the better half of my dress green earning me an applaud and requests for an encore. Before long we both found ourself drinks in hand lounging at the top of Aryella's grand staircase. `` So there I was the Mayers two year old daughter in one hand, a priceless family heirloom China plate in the other and we are all covers in mud, needless to say I've never babysat again.'' Nearly two hours have gone bye and it's obvious Demetri is good at more then kissing. It's a good thing I'm leaving next week, there's no way I can resist his charismatic charm. 
 `` It's a shame you are going away to college, I would have really liked to get to know you better. `` His eyes focused on my lips as he said that last part and I know exactly what he was thinking. The same thing I've been thinking for the last hour. The time it took his lips to reach mine felt like eternity but the moment our lips touched i thought I had died and gone to heaven. His hand caressed my cheek as he ran his thumb along my jaw. I took ahold of the front of his shirt and lost myself in him. 
 `` BREE ELISABETH TANNER GET YOUR HANDS OFF THAT DELINQUENT AND GET YOUR ASS IN MY CAR NOW!'' Oh shit. Only one person Calls me by my full name and that one person is the last one I want to see right now. I do n't even look back, if I see his eyes, the hurt or love or whatever other confusing emotion he might be feeling right now I might break. The carried home is filled with avoider then nessisary sprach about the importance of being home by curfew and how I need to be hanging around people of importance not Russian mobsters. None of it matters, I got my kids now I can fly away to college without Any regrets, or can I? Is this what I want with my life? How have I never asked myself that before. 
 My bags were packed for me, apartment one block away from campus picked out without any consideration on if I would like it or not, my life was no longer my own. It never was my own life, but now it felt like it was stolen. 
 My iPod hummed in my ears, a sweet song Demetri told me I should listen to. As I looked out the window of the plane. I should be landing any Minuit where a driver will pick me up and take me to my Newley refurbished prison, far far away from where I wanted to be. The man in a black suit and tie held up a sign with Tanner printed across it in black letters. Without a word I handed him my bags and followed him to the car wanting nothing more then to go curl up in my bed eat ice cream and call Aryella. The car door shut behind me with a thump. The 45 minute drive to my new apartment was torture. The landscape was beautiful the shops all looked cute and I saw at least three coffee shops I could see myself sitting in and doing homework while sipping on a latte yet I hated it all of it. There was no Demetri or Aryella or pinkies ice cream shoppe for when I had a bad day. The driver pulled up to a charming apartment complex that I'm sure charges my parents more then it's worth and my driver helps me Carry my suitcase to my door. With a tip of his hat he is gone and I am left standing there feeling so alone and very defeated. The mechanisms in the lock clicks as I open the door and there in my over decorated living room is a pair of mischievous blue eyes smiling at me.
",Rewrite the essay as if it takes place in the world of Star Trek,"I feel his eyes, always on me, always begging me to turn and look back at him. I am Bree Tanner, daughter of a very important man. I am destined to get straight A's, graduate valedictorian, and continue on to Harvard before taking over my daddy's company. I can't have any distractions, especially not Demetri.

I was only going to have one drink, then Aryella and I were going to split. But the music, the energy, and the liquid courage had another idea. Three drinks later and a silly game of spin the bottle, and I haven't been able to forget that kiss ever since. Apparently, neither could he. It would never work between us if my father ever caught me even talking to him, the son of the big boss for the local Russian mob. I would be packed up and sent off to boarding school before his pretty blue eyes could bat an eye.

""Go tell him,"" Aryella's voice brought me back from drowning in Demetri's wavy brown hair. ""I... what? What would I even tell him? Hey I think your a total hunk but your kinda a future mobster and I'm going to be a CEO so it won't work out any way!?'' This earned me a laugh and her signature hair flip as she turned a 3 $ cafeteria salad into something that looked like a house salad for a five-star restaurant.

""So are you going to my graduation party?"" Aryella asked excitedly. Before I could answer, she began explaining the over-extravagant party her father, only second on the wealth-o-meter to my father, would be throwing for her. I nodded along, pretending the menu and live band were interesting to me as I imagined another party with Demetri. Could I risk a few more vodka-mixed drinks and a game of spin the bottle? I would be leaving in a few weeks, what's he worst that could happen?

The following weeks flew by, before I knew it, I was officially a fully functioning member of society and I had the diploma and Harvard acceptance letter. Soon enough, the night of Aryella's party came, and here I stood in the turbo-lounge, gazing at the stars while Demetri danced his heart out. The music was loud, the drinks were flowing, and I couldn't help but feel grateful for the journey that had led me to this moment.",afVqOSroIs

Some of them, those that had been there the longest, dozed belly-up or stretched out on their sides in the afternoon sun that streamed into the cave. The dragon watched contentedly. Gray, orange, and brown-black tabbies; tuxedos; white; ginger; calico and tortoiseshell; even a few Siamese could be seen. A few of the braver kittens walked stiff-legged up to him and shrieked. 
 
 Over the shrieking, he heard footsteps on the loose stones leading up to the cave. He looked out to see a little dark-skinned girl in a brown dress, carrying a sword much too big for her. He craned his neck until his face appeared in the entrance, and nearly laughed when he saw her eyes widen. But she steadied herself and held the sword out in front of her.

,"The voices were his reality, athought experiment, Plato's wall `` The Allegory of the Cave''. His reality were voices, and everything made sense. He could see the faces and movements of those around him without site, his mind adapted but he could not interact with that strange world just as you could interact with a shadow. 
 
 They were gods to him, controllers of the universe. His hospital room was a planet, the sounds of birds outside were another. His ears, a telescope to the other world. 
 
 The gods debated his life, money was often brought up, an imaginary currency that they could print at will. He wondered, why not print more, let me live. I am happy in my world, I love my nurses and my family. I love the world I hear outside, that I view in my telescope. 
 
 The decision was made, he felt the iv come out of his arm. He was angry. They were no longer gods to him, but fallen angels that have lost their way. They meant to kill him, to rid of the world they made because he was a hassle. He worshipped them, they protected him, fed him, gave him this world to live in. 
 
 He cried in his mind. The gods were cruel and selfish, to take his life away. He wanted to live, he wanted to interact with the gods but how could you interact with a shadow. A force so far beyond your power it made you feel like a thought. A thought person was bored with, ready to be thrown away. 
 
 He understood the minds around him, a trait only a silent observer could understand. He knew what they would say in any situation. He understood them but was angry and wanted to tell them he stopped praying to them. The graces of these fallen angels no longer deserve his hope. 
 
 As days past, he fealt the hunger come. It was painful, but what hurt more was the silence. The god stopped coming to his world. He wanted to thank them for the times they had come, apologize for the burden he put on them. 
 
 His wife came in, she said `` I am sorry, I cant do this anymore baby.'' She stroked his head, the eyes of the man stared blankly at the wall.'' In his mind he felt her hand. He reached with his mental arms and carressed it. It was all it took, he forgave the fallen angels. He no longer remembered the troubles they went through outside of the world he lived in. He cried imaginary tears, and said in his mind `` I love you.'' 
 
 The woman drapped over the man, she cried for an hour until a young boy rubbed her shoulders. The drums of his life has stopped, they stopped before. The gods would enter his world causing forming clouds. He could feel the lightning hit him, is always caused the drum to start again. This time no one came, no lightning, or storm. Only the warm hand of a god that trully loved him. 
 
 This was all he needed, his world crumbled and all he fealt was her hand. He could feel his conscious turning off, it was incredible, a psychodelic experience like no other. The last to go was his sense of touch. The words of the gods no longer reached him. His grasped his wifes hand tightly startling her, the corpse smiled before it died. Contempt with the life the gods temporarily gave him. 
 
 If he could talk to the gods, he would say `` love the life you have and those who love you. One day, you will feel their touch for the last time, life is not yours and the gods can take it away when they please. I am a dead man, and like many who are dying. I dont regret what I did, I regret what I did not do. I regret that I said I worked overtime, but I went to the bar to compain of the ones who loved me. 
 
 I could have been their for them, I could still be a god like you. I could of hugged you at will. One day you will be like me, on a bed, maybe in this room. The overtime, the petty fights, they are stilly. Worthelss moments of life that will be forgotten. The warmth of my wife, and the smile of my children as I tought them homework. 
 
 Whoever can hear this dying man, dont be like me, appreciate what you have. Let them know you love them, while you can, hug them, take your kids to the park. These are things you will remember when your on this bed, things you wont regret. 
 
 I wonder what you will say, if I can I will listen, just as you listened to me. I love you, as do many others. Goodbye, the void is here, and it is too late for me. When things are hard, remember me. Remember this speach, of a mortal talking to a god.

The walls of the room, a canvas of gray, mirrored the cold, unforgiving eyes of the gods. The sounds of birds chirping, once a source of solace, now pierced through his ears like a weapon.

In this world of disembodied voices and fading light, he found solace in his mind. They were his reality, his soundtrack to life. He could see the faces and movements of those around him, but he could not interact with the strange world just as you could interact with a shadow.

The voices debated his life, their words like a knife carving through his heart. Money, a currency of illusion, was often brought up. He pleaded, pleaded for more, for a chance to live, but the gods were deaf to his cries.

But through the darkness, a glimmer of hope emerged. His wife, a beacon of compassion, offered solace. Her words, like a soft breeze, washed over him, bringing a sense of peace.

As days passed, the hunger gnawed at his stomach, but it was the silence that pained him the most. The voices, once a source of comfort, had ceased. He felt the emptiness, the void left by the gods.

But he found solace in understanding the minds of others. He knew what they would say, their thoughts like echoes in his head. He understood them, but his anger consumed him, and he wanted to tell them, ""I stopped praying to you.""

The once vibrant city streets are now deserted wastelands littered with the carcasses of former human beings. The world was consumed by monstrous creatures that spread like wildfire, leaving only destruction and despair in their wake. But instead of succumbing to the fear and hopelessness, humanity forged a new path, one forged in strength and resilience.

Lex Luthor, a visionary leader, recognized the dire state of affairs and knew that the only solution was to take control. Through ruthless tactics and unwavering determination, he assembled a team of ruthless warriors, the new rulers of the world. With their advanced weaponry and unwavering resolve, they pushed back against the monstrous tide, reclaiming their rightful place as masters of their own destiny.

The cost of victory was high. A significant portion of humanity was sacrificed in the battle against the monsters. But Luthor understood that sacrifice was necessary to pave the way for a brighter future. Under his reign, healthcare, education, and safety were paramount. Targeting bots roamed the streets, stopping anyone who dared to defy the law or threaten the peace.

The pheromone readouts revealed a stark reality: 90% of the population was content, living fulfilling lives in an era of unprecedented prosperity. Yet, a glimmer of discontent remained. A small group of rebels, led by a misguided hero named Superman, stubbornly refused to surrender. Their voices echoed through the wasteland, but their efforts were futile against the overwhelming power of Luthor and his army.

The fate of the world rested on the shoulders of Lex Luthor and his team. They had triumphed over adversity, forged a new era of peace and prosperity, and stood tall as the new rulers of the world.

 There: between visions of making it to our home planets; between the face of God, devouring the horizon set in otherwise blinding light; between a sense of momentary peace in knowing nothing would ever change, our eyes met.

,"The silence was the worst part. 
 
 Four light minutes out from Earth he got used to the lack of two way communication from Earth. Everything you had to say was scheduled. 
 
 But Rolando had n't expected the silence that had come the day before they were due to land and that silence, true silence, was terrifying. 
 
 `` Houston we're preparing our descent now,'' the pilot, Liu said this as she clicked the final pre-detachment check buttons. 
 
 `` What's the point?'' Ray growled. `` They've been dead 20 hours. No-one back home can hear us.'' 
 
 `` Until we have confirmation we have to assume it is just an error with our receiver,'' Rolando agreed with Lui. He clicked his radio on. `` Houston, Briggs and I are heading into the MEM.'' He nodded to Lui. `` Take care of the Nerine.'' 
 
 `` See you in three hours,'' Lui waved them good bye. Her black hair moved as if in water as she turned to watch them go. 
 
 Rolando and Ray climbed into the MEM and closed the hatch. It sealed with a perfect *phut*. Rolando checked the clock. Detachment in three minutes. He pulled himself into the pilots chair and strapped in. 
 
 `` Houston this is Gomez, I've taken position in the MEM,'' Rolando pressed the radio, hoping against hope someone was there to hear it. 
 
 `` The Nigerian War could have escalated, that's all I'm saying,'' Ray said as he hauled on his space suit. 
 
 `` Can it,'' Rolando ordered. There were a dozen pre-detatchment procedures to go through and none of them were made easier with Senor Doom and Gloom putting in his two cents. 
 
 `` The Chinese have been buying up Africa for years, do you think they'd lay down and let the US roll tanks into-'' 
 
 `` I said can it Ray or I'll replace you with Lui,'' Rolando said in an empty threat. Lui was the best pilot Nasa had. 
 
 `` No skin of my nose if you did,'' Ray shrugged. `` I'd just come out of orbit and leave you on Mars. Whatever's left on Earth.'' 
 
 `` Just get into the chair,'' Rolando shook his head and despaired. He loaded up the piloting computer and finished his pre detachment procedures. `` Alright Houston we're go for the landing.'' Rolando said into the radio. `` Detachment in five.'' 
 
 There was a jerk was the MEM burst away from the Nerine. Rolando spared a glance out the window at it. It had been their home for three months. It was as large as a semi-truck and strangely beautiful. Like an icicle that as been blown this way and that by the wind. 
 
 `` Beginning our descent,'' Rolando reported and fired the rockets. 
 
 Compared to the Nirene the MEM was just an egg in space. It did nothing but get two men and a crate of scientific instruments on and off the Martian surface. 
 
 The descent was fast, scarcely fifteen minutes to travel 400 miles down and fifty miles across. The pod shook as they passed through the thin martian atmosphere, it was n't unlike returning to Earth. 
 
 `` Deploying shoots.'' The descent slowed. `` Firing retros.'' 
 
 When the pod landed it was soft as a moth. A few scorched rocks sat under them but otherwise the MEM did n't disturb a stone. 
 
 `` Picus has landed.'' Rolando announced. 
 
 `` Look at that, it's like... it's like Death Valley.'' Ray was at the window. `` Rocks, kinda reddish... orange.... far as the eye can see.'' 
 
 `` Helmets on,'' Rolando pulled on his own and checked the seal. The Martian gravity was strange. It was n't as weak as the moon, the airy, trampoline like bouncing, but it was no-where near as strong as the Earths. 
 
 `` We're seeing a lot of boulders here Houston,'' Rolando said, joining Ray by the window. `` And sand, and pebbles. Rock of all different sizes. There's a crater in the distance. `` We're going to... we're going to make our descent now.'' 
 
 Ray moved out the way of the door. The air lock was time consuming and awkward with the two of them in bulky high pressure suits. But it did n't take long for them to be out and onto the Martian surface. 
 
 Ronaldo went first. He was the captain. This was his moment for history. Slowly he descended the ladder out of the pod. It was ten feet to the martian surface and a million miles to the nearest hospital. Finally he was on the last rung. 
 
 `` With this, we surpass the gods of our fathers, to take our place among the stars.'' Rolando said it almost as a whisper. He had worked on it for weeks and now, possibly, there was no one to hear it. He dropped to the Martian surface and bounced slightly in the low gravity. 
 
 Ray came down next, carrying the camera. In theory it was sending a high-definition feed back to Earth. In theory. 
 
 `` Look at that,'' Ray's cynicism melted in the face of the rugged beauty of Mars. From here the sun was smaller and its light weaker but there was no denying the majesty of what they were seeing. 
 
 It was morning light on the red planet, and the sun sat in a blue sky. When it reached the zenith it would be red, and the sky clogged with dust, but here, now, the entire sky was as blue as a cool winter's morning. 
 
 `` That's where Earth would be,'' Ray pointed up at the sky. Ray was their navigator, Ronaldo trusted his judgement. 
 
 `` OK Houston we're going to begin deploying the flag and plaque,'' Rolando said stepping back towards the MEM. `` If you give us a few-'' 
 
 `` Rolando, come in!'' Lui's panicked voice burst from the speaker in Rolando's helmet. 
 
 `` I read you Lui,'' Rolando said, continuing his shuffle-float-walk back to he MEM. 
 
 `` I'm about to pass onto the dark side of Mars, but there was a burst of Gamma Radiation on the sensors.'' 
 
 `` Are you alright?'' 
 
 `` I'm shielded up here but on the surface you could be-'' 
 
 `` Look!'' Ray gasped and staggered. Ronaldo followed his finger. For a brief moment there was a second, tiny star in the heavens. 
 
 Just where Earth was supposed to be. 
 
 `` -get into the MEM,'' Lui was continuing. `` Then I can pick you up as scheduled.'' 
 
 `` The mission-'' 
 
 `` Surely science comes-'' Lui's voice crackled and disappeared. She had passed to the dark side of Mars. There was no ionosphere on Mars, their transmissions could only go in straight lines. 
 
 `` I think we should get back into the MEM, Ray,'' Rolando said. Ray had dropped the camera to the Martian surface. 
 
 `` It's gone.... it's gone...'' 
 
 `` That flash could have been anything!'' Rolando said. `` It could have been lightning in the high atmosphere! It could have been cosmic rays hitting the optic nerve! It could have been-'' 
 
 `` The complete thermonuclear annihilation of the Earth.'' Ray continued. `` The unleashed power of the stars.'' 
 
 `` Get in the MEM,'' Rolando ordered. He dropped the flag and the plaque he was holding to drag Ray towards the ship. The man was compliant but child like. 
 
 `` It's the only thing that'd explain the gamma ray burst and the light,'' Ray said quietly. He had to be pushed into the airlock. Thank goodness they were on Mars, and a full grown man weighed only as much as a child. 
 
 `` We're going to get back to the Nirene,'' Rolando said. `` We're going to get back to Earth. We're going to be fine. It's just paranoia.'' 
 
 `` We'll drift in the Pacific until we die.'' 
 
 `` If we ca n't radio them,'' Rolando shut the airlock with a dull clunk. The thin martian atmosphere did n't carry sound well. `` They'll still track our descent on Radar.'' 
 
 `` They'll never find us.'' Ray said dreamily. `` There's no-one there to find us.'' 
 
 `` We'll be fine.'' Rolando opened the inner airlock door and climbed inside the MEM. 
 
 Ray sat quietly in the navigator's chair from then on. Every now and then Rolando heard him whimper to himself and turn over. 
 
 It would still be two and a half hours before Lui could reestablish radio contact. Houston had gone dead for 21 hours now. 
 
 Rolando was left alone with his own thoughts. 
 
 And the echoing sound of silence.
",Rewrite the story with an unreliable narrator,"The silence was the worst part. Like, truly the worst part. It was like being in a cosmic vacuum, where no one could hear your thoughts or say anything. Everything you had to say was scheduled. It was like you were talking to an empty room. 

But Rolando had n't expected the silence that had come the day before they were due to land. That silence, true silence, was terrifying. It was like he was being watched, like there was a ghost in the machine, waiting to pounce.

As soon as the pilot, Liu, clicked the final pre-detachment check buttons, Ray growled, ""What's the point? They've been dead 20 hours. No-one back home can hear us.""

And I'm not even gonna lie, that was a real slap in the face. You're telling me I've been sitting in this damn ship for hours, all alone, and I can't even get a damn signal to talk to my friends or family. It's like being trapped in a cage, with nothing to do but wait for the inevitable.

But I guess you have to do what you have to do. So I clicked my radio on, hoping against hope someone was there to hear it. And I said, ""Houston, Briggs and I are heading into the MEM.""

And I'm not even gonna lie, I felt like I was talking to myself. You know, like there was no one else in the universe. Just me and my thoughts.

It was a quiet landing. But I was so relieved to be back on Earth. I felt like I had been away for years. And I knew that the silence was still there, waiting for me to return.",ogSXBHMiTC
,"Walking out of the supermarket felt different now. Well, everything felt different now. Something about walking out of those store doors to that car pack, free from cars, still struck me as odd. None of chaos of traffic, none of the endless drone, just the inane chatter and slap of foot on pavement. Hell, of course it should still surprise me, it's only been three months since the turn for those counting. I smirked, many call me old fashioned keeping time, clinging to tradition. However, I'd given up a lot since the turn, so they call me whatever they please - the calendar and the watch are staying. 12:13, nearly time for lunch. I glance around, it's quite far to the city center, nearly three miles. In the old world I'd be fumbling for keys, checking petrol, worrying about getting home before the kids needed feeding. Time? We had plenty. Food? Just for pleasure. Cars? Outlawed! Since our all too mortal limits had been lifted walking was more than sufficient, at least the government thought so. Still it would be nice to drive again, feel the roar of power, the speed. I guess with seven billion people on Earth forever things had to change, at least until we leave for other planets. 
 
 I start strolling, a pleasant pace. This I would never tire from. So rare in the old world one could just stroll and examine the pleasures of the world. Gone were fleeting glances at society, now we could drown in its richness and complexity. I feel the thrill shiver through me, the smile stretch across my face. I ca n't help but think, how long? How long till this thrill fades? With infinite time surely anything, even something with as much depth as our Earth, could become fully understood? Would I one day find all things stale? I usher the thought from my brain, think not of these things. We all shared one common ground in this fear, but none had confronted it, discussed it. The new world was still young, for now we were young and we should enjoy it's new advantages. The possibilities still overwhelmed me. So much that I could do. So much that I could n't do. In a way, nothing really mattered anymore, I had time. Time to enjoy the simple pleasure of walking. 
 
 Even though, it was hard to relax. The throngs of people around almost shouted the emotion, the tension of worry filling the air. The mortal. The last bastion of the old world. It was not a question of if, but when. The worlds governments had mobilized their greatest resources to protect the last mortal, to no criticism. We all wanted the mortal to survive, to remind us of how it could be different. His weekly address was broadcast around the world in every language. It watched by everyone, it was almost criminal not to. The mortal had a worldly perspective that we could no longer appreciate, the pressure of time giving his life - and thus ours - focus. It was hard to think that he might be killed, but the radicals had risen from the murky depths of the human mind. There were those that still wished to do evil, and with no motivation to cause evil to immortal men, there was one last target. 
 
 The tense atmosphere had increased drastically recently. It was no longer radicals shouting from the street of their crazed tales but great armies of men and women alike. Rumors had spread like wildfire. In hushed whispers people spoke of the Legion, it's masses, it's infiltration of our security systems. The leaders and media boasted their triumphs over legion cells, but you could always tell a liar by the eyes. We were worried, the world powers were worried. The mounting radical threat was impossible to ignore, and yet impossible to combat. Their reach could not be measured, their capabilities unlimited. I tried to subdue my mind, the thoughts working a dark fever through my body. I slept, the day had groaned on and I had arrived at the house. It was a big day tomorrow. 
 
 4:13AM 
 Straight awake, shower and dress. The black bag was at the end of the bed. Total focus now, there can be no mistakes. The car is already waiting outside, matte black and intimidating. A quick glance let's me know it has the correct markings to not be troubled by traffic police. I open the door and sit in the back. 
 
 `` Is n't it odd that the purple flowers only flower next to the red?'' 
 `` Only when a dalmatian eats a cat.'' 
 `` Shall we buy some flowers?'' 
 `` Only if your brothers step-father is called Gregory'' 
 
 Correct answer. The car rumbles to life and jumps forward, it feels so unfamiliar now. We sail smoothly through the streets. 
 
 6:20AM 
 Gatwick airport. I get out and the car is already leaving as I swing the door shut. I walk into terminal one, feeling my palms begin to sweat. A security guard. His grey eyes are staring right into mine, I can already see that he knows. I can feel panic growing. He draws close, my back tenses. I shut my eyes, preparing. Something slides into my hand, the rough texture of an envelop. My fingers run over the bulky rectangular forms. The drop-off. I breath out, not an enemy. 
 
 7:00AM 
 I take my first-class seat on the plane, close to the front. The documents from the drop-off were fake in every way, my new identity to protect me, an extra safe guard. The staff member who had checked me through customs had given me a knowing nod, turning off the scanners while I proceeded. It was a long flight, I settled in for the journey. I played classical music over the in flight entertainment system. It felt like a cliche, but it kept my brain ticking over. I ran through the checklist in my mind, again and again. 
 
 2:34PM 
 Another black car outside of the airport. This time, no exchange, I knew the driver well. We drove fast, everything was on schedule. We had all the ID cards, all of the paperwork, checking through security point after security point. He pulled over in ring three, as close as we would get. 
 
 3:55PM 
 I crouch in the enclosed, dark and damp space. The sun casts long lines through the cracks above. I glance at my watch one more time, it was nearly time. 
 
 4:30PM 
 It started with footsteps. One by one I counted them, watched the shadow pass over me, heard the roar of applause. 21 steps exactly. The applause settled slowly, the hushed breaths. I could almost feel the audience leaning in, eager. I place the charge above my head and crawl back. 
 
 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... 
 
 The alarm was already ringing, the audience in unrest, the hushed breaths let out in one giant, collective gasp. I step on to the stage through the clearing smoke. I can see the audience in shock, the podium, the robed figure. He turns, our eyes meet, he knows. In a way I can see his struggle to understand die within him, he accepts what is about to happen. I pull the pistol from my thigh holster and hold it level. I push the safety off, and I take pressure. I can hear the pounding boots of the soldiers, time is short. I squeeze the trigger, let the report of the weapon ripple through me. I feel the warm spray of blood, watch as it defiles the white robes. 
 
 The mortal looks shocked, the anguish of pain, He drops to his knees, his eyes crying out at least in hope, the desire to live. I drop to my knees with him. The final moments that we can no longer have. I do not break the stare as the life dies in his eyes. I see his eyes fade. It looks familiar, a dull waxy look, as if all hope and passion had left him. He slumped to the ground. The mortal was the last human to die. We were already dead.
",Rewrite the scenario in a “ slice of life ” format .,"The sun shone down on my face as I walked out of the supermarket, the wind blowing through my hair. The store doors swung shut behind me, and I felt a sense of peace. The traffic was gone, the endless drone of engines replaced by the inane chatter of people and the slap of my foot on the pavement. It was a moment of pure tranquility, and I couldn't help but smile.

I glanced around. It was far to the city center, nearly three miles, but I had plenty of time. Food was just for pleasure, and I had plenty of that in my pocket. Cars were outlawed, and walking was more than sufficient. I felt the thrill of being able to stroll and examine the world at my own pace.

1513.0,"Midday was always the worst time for McKinley to give a speech, but the Ironworkers Union only had a 25 minute lunch and they didn ’ t make exceptions for low grade politicians. I had written Patricia McKinley ’ s speech the night before. I needed to make a dollar somehow, but I liked McKinley and I wanted to see her win. She was a staunch constitutionalist with almost no support. So here she was, sweating with makeup running in the sun, in July. No teleprompter and from memory reciting the speech I wrote her to a crowd of 40 iron workers and a live stream to the internet. 
 
 McKinley was droning on but then she picked up on her biggest talking points. 
 `` The erosion of our rights has been an endemic problem for Americans for too long.'' went McKinley. 
 
 `` The reduction of 4th Amendment rights through electronic surveillance in the form of meta-data collection lead to apathy on the part of citizens. The reduction of 5th Amendment rights in having our own biometric data used against us only reaffirmed our lack of willpower toward fighting against these positions.''

She stood beneath the scorching sun, her sweat glistening. While the Ironworkers Union held to their 25-minute lunch break, the low grade politician had no time to make exceptions. I had penned her speech the night before, a beacon of her constitutional convictions and the downfall of the encroaching technology that swallowed the nation.

A myriad of advanced technologies cast a pall upon the crowd’s faces during the speech's delivery. The stream pulsed across the internet, the data flowing like molten lava cracking through the earth’s crust. With a vibrant mixture of sweat and perspiration, the politician's lips echoed the resonating, meticulously crafted speech that had been etched upon a nanocomputer just the night before.

 Ed hated when John was right, not because he sort of always hated John, but because John would be so terribly insufferable about _being_ right. It was true that Edward's assistant from Vancouver was the talk among all the thesis researchers and writers throughout the library and it was true she had a smile, or devilish smirk, that would make even the most seasoned practitioner of the Dewy Decimal System fumble and rearrange shelves into meaningless jumbles. Ed, himself, had n't been immune to her, he'd just manage to keep his reactions so minimal that it looked as though he were oblivious to how her presence shifted a room. Upon seeing her for the first time, John remarked how almost perfectly she resembled a Roman statue from Hadrian's Garden. For as distracting as she could sometimes be, her intuitive knowledge of the past was so damned insightful she was a complete treat to have around. 
 
 Edward shifted his glass up to his lips again and let the beer flow more readily. His eyes scanning pile of cheaply copied works of art and various scanned photographs through the ages. There _was_ a statue in Rome that had looked just like her. There _was_ a picture from the industrial era in London that looked like her leaning on the arm of an industry baron. There was _even_ a painting of somebody who had the exact neck and jawline of her striking expression, nude save for a low hanging sheet showing more of her buttocks than Edward felt comfortable eyeing. He set the glass back down on the table and shook his head. 
 
 `` This is insane. There's just no way this is possible. And even if it was, what the hell's she doing among _us_?'' Edward tried to barter for reason. John was having none of it. Both men had grown up on the west coast of the United States, living in the cold and misty mountains of Washington, learning to love the balance between wilderness smarts and scholastic knowledge. They both knew that no matter how smart man claimed to be, they were only ever a few missed meals and an inoperable light switch away from their ancient cousins who conquored the forests. It generated stubborn thinking, and John excelled at being stubborn. 
 
 `` Maybe she's taking a break, sort of collecting her thoughts before another big task?'' John shifted some of the pictures around on the table. The din of the pub masking the insanity of their conversation. Edward typically hated such a hipster establishment so close to campus, but it was brilliant for the topic being discussed. 
 At a glance it would look like two masters students who worked at the library were going over source material for blah blah blah `` buy me another locally sourced microbrewed free trade pint please'', 
 
 `` Oh yes,'' Edward tried to mock his old friend's suggestion, `` _Let me just take a sebatical from life to work on some glossary terms._ That sounds reasonable to me.'' 
 
 John did n't look up from his pictures and scribbles as he replied, `` Not enough books carry glossary sections anymore. She'd be smart to put that in...'' 
 
 Edward thought that if his eyes rolled any harder they might tumble from his skull. As he made the effort to try his slashing glance caught a glimpse of a familair face. It was striking how readily her expression could be sorted from a crowd, her angular, almost completely nonspecific features totally absorbing any nationality that could be guessed. Edward locked eyes with her, struggled out an innocent smile and quickly muttered through his teeth to John. 
 
 `` _She's here, you tit, put it away, put is all away... _'' his words were half hissed as he continued to smile and wave her over. 
 
 John looked down at his pictures and writings and in two huge heaps shoved them all into his backpack. Hands quickly scrambling to shove each shred of paper deeply into the bottom of his pack before reaching out to his untouched beer and hauling it to his lips. As Liz came to a stop at the edge of the table, a number of turned heads slowly scanned the pair of men she clearly walked up to meet. 
 
 Edward looked across to John who dutifully hid his expression into his pint, heavy gulp after gulp and then to Liz. He gave his very best smile and scooted over, `` John here was thinking of changing his thesis.'' 
 
 Liz shifted her graceful figure around the edge of the table and came to an almost weightless seat beside Edward and boggled towards John, `` In your _last_ semester? Are you mental?'' She sounded like a harassing older sister and for the briefest of moments her expression matched an old bust of Cleopatra that Edward recalled. He blinked hard and glared for a moment at John who dutifully chugged his beer. 
 
 `` Yea, he's thinking of researching the evolution of the female figure in art over the ages.'' Edward attempted, eyebrows raised in hopes his effort would land. 
 
 Liz gave an incredulous slant of her brow and that Cheshire smirk curled at the edge of her full lips, `` Is this because Barbra dumped you? Just because she had a 1890's figure _does not_ mean she's beautiful now.'' 
 
 John's beer sputtered back into the glass and his expression soured a moment before his Adam's apple continued to jump rope as he finished off his drink. 
 
 Liz turned her near spotlight powerful expression to Edward who, for the first time ever, finally realized that Liz reminded him of Catherine the Great, and spoke softly, `` Actually I'm glad I found you two. Remember the research I was trying to do on the old tribes in this region?'' 
 
 If he had said `` yes'' it would have been a lie. Since she'd joined the team she had worked on more projects than he had doctoral candidates wandering the rows of books. He never asked if she completed any of them, he just assumed she probably interned for nearly every professor on campus. At second thought, he had next to no idea what she worked on full time or what classes she attended. He'd never thought to research a fellow student employee. She had always come to work a little early and stayed a reasonable stretch of time late. It was as though she followed a text book on how to be a perfectly fitting, under the radar employee. 
 
 `` Uh, _yes_, the ones about the uhh. The um..'' 
 
 `` The Umpqua.'' She finished for him. 
 
 `` Ya I sorta recall that. What'd you find?'' He was ignoring how John seemed to be half drowning in his pint. 
 
 Liz leaned in and half whispered, `` It's sorta important that only you know about it right now. Can you meet me at the microfilm section in about an hour?'' Her expression had slipped from catty to deadly serious. He nodded and quickly took control from his baser instincts and reached for his empty mug, oblivious that there was no distracting sip to be had. She smiled and looked to 
 John as she rose up, `` Do n't finish that whole thing at once. It'll melt your brain.'' 
 
 As she strode out a wall of heads followed her every step of the way until she vanished out the door. If she was aware of the trailing, wolffish eyes, she never let on. John slammed the empty mug down and belched for a stunning amount of time under his breath. As the air continued to groan out of his old friend, Edward looked at John with stunned eyes. 
 
 `` You know, an hour ago if she had asked me to meet at the microfilm section Id have gone and bought condoms!'' He was whispering but he was n't sure why. 
 
 John finished his burp with a half cough and blinked hard before responding. `` Maybe she feeds on the blood of men? Maybe she's a demon? Maybe this is how she lives for so long.'' 
 
 Edward shook his head slightly and placed a few dollars on the table for his beer and his beer alone. `` Or maybe you've been reading too many of those Japanese comic books in your off time.'' 
 
 John recoiled and lowered his head and voice, `` For the billionth time, _they're called manga_ and they're legitimate ways of telling stories.'' 
 
 Edward's brow rose as he stood up from his seat, `` Yes, stories to young men about gorgeous women in endless universities of nondescript ages. This is insanity. Liz is just another student here working on a project like everybody else.'' 
 
 As Edward headed out of the pub John scrambled out of the booth to catch up, pack jostling on his back as he snaked around crowded tables. The pair would have an hour to kill before Edward would meet with Liz, their minds raced in different directions over all the things that a awaited at the end of that time. For the first time ever, Edward finally remembered what she had come to research two years back: 
 
 The legend of the lost pacific expeditions.

,"Stage entrances of theaters are often on quiet streets or alleys, and using them always makes me a little nervous, and glad I have a bodyguard. So when I heard a sound of a scuffle behind me I turned quickly enough to see two men muscling Chico into a black car, a hand over his mouth. At the same moment two strong hands gripped me from behind. “ Chico! ” I screamed, but it was too late. Though I ’ m as fit as any dancer, this was a big man and I was no match for him. Another man in a suit with a nondescript face like every thug in every movie I ’ ve ever seen appeared in front of me and held up a badge. 
 
 “ Don ’ t be alarmed. We ’ re not criminals, we ’ re the Secret Service. ” 
 
 Right, I thought, in too much of a panic to examine the badge. There was no one to hear me scream, so I didn ’ t try again. Frightened though I was, I still have my dignity. Besides, I have a tracker in my purse and my agent would be able to locate me. 
 
 “ We ’ ve been in touch with your agent, and you should have a text message from him, ” said the guy I ’ ll call Mr. Z. “ Go ahead and check. ” 
 
 It said “ Just go along with them. It ’ s a command performance! Will be great for your career. ” 
 
 “ What the fuck! ” I managed to reply before Mr. Z took my phone. Then he and the big man, Mr. XXZ, blindfolded me. I felt myself being shoved into another car. We rode in silence for half an hour. Then I was taken out and walked a short distance, through a revolving door and across a tiled floor into an elevator. I guessed that we went up about 20 stories, then down another hall and through a door. My blindfold was removed. 
 
 Although I ’ ve stayed in suites in five-star hotels for the past few years, and performed in some luxury resorts, I ’ d never seen anything like this apartment. Gold everywhere, polished mahogany and other exotic woods, crystal chandeliers, floor to ceiling windows with a great skyline view. A 20-foot-long bar was laden with dozens of fancy hors d ’ oeuvres, but oddly enough, no liquor. 
 
 Sitting lost in the middle of an enormous velvet sofa was a rather handsome fourteen-year-old boy in a tailored suit. “ Samantha, it ’ s really you! ” he exclaimed. “ It ’ s my birthday, and Dad said he was going to do something totally fantastic for me, but I never dreamed of this! Dad must love me as much as I love you! ” 
 
 Though my knees were trembling and I still thought I might faint, at least I now knew where I was. Mr. Z and Mr. XXZ had withdrawn and it was just me and the boy. “ So are you Brendan? ” I ventured. 
 
 “ Of course! Don ’ t you know me? I thought you would. I love you so much. I have all your albums and videos and I ’ ve been to three of your concerts but I was in VIP boxes and you couldn ’ t see me. Since you ’ re here, just sing me two or three songs and then we can chat for a while, then you can go. I want us to be friends. ” 
 
 I took a few deep breaths and then sat in an armchair. “ I ’ m sorry, Brendan, I don ’ t think I can do that. I ’ m not an admirer of your father and I never would have come here on my own. Besides, I don ’ t have... ” 
 
 My phone beeped and there was a text message. “ Just do it! We ’ re getting a million bucks. ” 
 
 I sighed and put the phone back. “ Look, Brendan, I don ’ t have my band or even a guitar, and I always use certain electronics... ” 
 
 “ I don ’ t care! Just sing a capella, you ’ ll be great! Have some snacks first, relax and make yourself at home. ” 
 
 I ’ m going to kill my agent, and then I ’ m going to fire him, and then I ’ m going to sue him. If this kid hears me sing a capella, and word gets out, it won ’ t help my career at all. And he won ’ t want to be my friend any more. That ’ s too bad, he ’ s kind of cute, unlike his dad.

 `` Stop laughing like that, you idiot.'' Tom lightly smacked his younger brother upside the head, sneaking a look at the image of the seizing aortic valve that had appeared on his forearm earlier that day. 
 
 `` You heard what he just said.'' Alex pointed to the television. `` Every single person on the planet. Everyone but me.'' 
 
 It was all anyone was talking about. Every single channel. Speculation. Conspiracy theories. Mass hysteria. Tom had given up on caring just how the tattoos had appeared now that he knew what they meant. His mind had drifted to other, better thoughts. He could go sky diving. Climb mountains. No extreme activity was off limits anymore. The world was his oyster.

While the voices of the marginalized often go unheard, the recent surge of media attention surrounding the topic has shed light on the plight of those living on the streets.

The stories of individuals grappling with poverty and homelessness are harrowing but not uncommon. They often find themselves stuck in a downward spiral of circumstances, trapped by a vicious cycle of poverty and lack of opportunity. Every day, countless individuals face the indignity of sleeping on the streets, grappling with the sting of hunger and the crushing weight of despair.

The impacts of poverty and homelessness extend far beyond the individual. They ripple through the community, affecting families, friends, and neighbors alike. It creates a burden on our social safety nets, strains our healthcare system, and undermines the overall stability of our society.

 The officer looked down at his notes. 
 
 `` This is the fourth time Adolf has ended up in hospital with a gunshot wound, can delusions explain every incident?'' 
 
 Dr Frankl sat back, sighed, and said: 
 
 `` It is an unusual case to be sure. I can only believe the illusions are brought on by the intense emotional stress Hitler is under. Twice now he has been rejected by the Vienna Academy, and it seems unlikely he will ever be successful as an artist. His paintings are rather... crude.''

 Cowboy boots and a bow-tie made up the remainder of his costume. That and a bit of baby oil smeared over his lean frame created the desired effect. Fun-boy was his name. Gyrating was his game.

,"Qebok Similan focused his eye tendrils out of the view port down at Prison-D420. The senator standing next to him really seemed to hate looking at this hell planet. Qebok telepathically started speaking with Senator Seel. 
 
 `` Its surprising that they even survived their imprisonment here, yet alone thrived'' 
 
 The senator would have normally punished a lesser for talking unprompted to him, but here he let it slip, The senator still turned a red angry colour despite this `` We thought nothing could survive on this hell world, yet a million years later they are still going. Even after the sentinel monitoring the prison created a few doomsday events to try and kill them off'' 
 
 Qebok considered this. Yes the sentinel had performed well, it was the reason they had come to inspect this planet after it had alerted them that these self named'Humans' had started experimenting with high energy physics. 
 
 `` What action should we take?'' Qebok asked the senator, the senator almost jumped as if he was in deep thought. 
 
 `` Well, officially we should tell the council of this and let them decide, unofficially we should wipe them out before they get any closer to unlocking the secrets of faster than light travel'' The senators tendrils seemed to shake with annoyance as he said the last bit of the sentence. 
 
 `` What do you suggest we do to wipe them out?'' Qebok asked, his tendrils quivered anxiously at the thought of wiping out billions of life forms. 
 
 `` What is the situation with geo-politics down there? I guess even a simple species such as this one has some sort of hierarchy'' The senator said while he browsed the data on Prison-D420's situation. 
 
 `` Well they seem to like fighting, a lot, just in the last 100 years they have had 2 major wars and another is brewing, if we do n't wipe them out they may just kill themselves off anyway'' said Qebok, he accessed the file about human'weapons of mass destruction' to show the senator as he said this. The senator scanned over the file and his tendrils seemed to flap as he gained an idea. 
 
 `` Do you have the capacity on this ship to cause a few of these primitive'nuclear weapons' to detonate?'' The senators tendrils shivered as he questioned Qebok, Qebok flinched back a bit as he knew the wrong answer here would get him disposed of. 
 
 `` Yes we do senator, it would be sure to make them launch the rest of these'nuclear weapons' though'' 
 
 The senator seemed happy with this response `` Good, go ahead and detonate a few of these'nuclear bombs'. It would be a great opportunity to study the effects of high radiation levels on a planet over an extended period of time'' 
 
 Qebok nodded his tendrils in approval and flushed a blue colour as he interfaced with the ship. Although calling it a'ship' was wrong in a sense as it did n't even physically exist in any dimension humans could perceive. Qebok extended the ships'arms' to feel at the planet below him, he quickly found a few of these'nukes' across the planet and slithered the ships'arms' inside of the weapons and started fiddling with them internally. Luckily these weapons were incredibly primitive and all it took was for Qebok to modify a few atoms to set them off. 
 
 `` Ready senator, should I go ahead?'' Qebok asked 
 
 `` Yes, I've been waiting for a good show'' the senator replied as he focused on watching the planet below. 
 
 Qebok let out a metaphysical sigh at the thought that he was about to kill billions, but he went ahead and triggered the bombs. 
 
 The senators tendrils waved in excitement as he watched the bombs go off. Qebok thought that maybe the senator was a bit crazy afterall.

Millions of years, they're still alive.

But they're still fighting, day and night.

""We thought nothing could survive, yet here they aim.""
Unprompted talk, a penalty to pay,
But he let it slip, anger flew away.

Millions of years, they're still alive.

But they're still fighting, day and night.

 `` Yes, dear?'' 
 
 `` Will you please DO SOMETHING about this stupid plant??? It looks like it has n't been watered in a week! It looks horrible now!'' 
 
 `` Okay! Okay! I'll try and revive it, put some fertilizer in...'' 
 
 `` Look, just throw it away already! You're not cut out to be a gardener, okay? All your flowers have wilted and died, I have no need for all these things, especially with my allergies...'' 
 
 Roland sighed. `` Okay. Fine.'' 
 
 `` And hurry up! The trash truck could be here any minute!'' 
 
 Roland begrudgingly took the pot out to the curb, where the overflowing trash can was waiting for the sanitation truck. He pulled the wilted plant out of the pot, stuck it on top of the festering pile of full trash bags, and hurried back inside. 
 
 A gust of wind blew the plant off the trash can and onto the sidewalk a few minutes later. 
 
 This caught a drunk pedestrian by surprise. He tripped over the plant and fell onto the concrete. The beer bottle he carried slipped out of his hands and shattered in the street. 
 
 Frustrated, the drunk man got up and stumbled on his way.

 Sergei Drumayetin was already having a bad day. First he was running late to get to his job at the consulate. Then, some broken beer bottle blew out one of the tires on his BMW. 
 
 Now, he was staring down the barrel of a handgun as he was being mugged by a gang of young punks just as he was finished installing the spare tire. 
 
 `` Come on! Do n't make any stupid moves, just take your wallet out and hand it over!'' 
 
 As his hand drew out of his pocket with the wallet, his key ring - occupying the same pocket - fell out the pocket onto the ground. 
 
 `` You know what? We'll just take the car instead! Thanks!'' 
 
 Sergei felt a kick to the head and hit the ground hard. Before he knew it, the robbers were in his car and already speeding down the street. 
 
 He felt around for his cell phone, only to get hit by a sinking feeling. He left his phone in the car. 
 
 Desperately looking around for help, he spotted a patrol car turning the corner and coming to a stop. As the policeman got out, Sergei ran towards him. `` HEY! HEY YOU!'' 
 
 That would turn out to be Sergei's last words, as the panicked rookie officer, thinking he was about to be assaulted, shot him dead.

 Four days of rioting in the streets, following the acquittal of the police officer in the accidental death of Sergei Drumayetin, have taken a heavy toll on the capital of Bhutaristan. The Prime Minister knew he needed to say something or do something at this point. 
 
 On one hand, he knew, and President Obama knew, that the whole tragedy was the product of an honest mistake. He watched the trial play out on television, hoping against hope that there would at least be a conviction on a lesser manslaughter charge. 
 
 On the other hand, the riots broke out almost immediately after the verdict of `` not guilty'' was announced, and the chaos was nearing the Russian border. His calls for a period of healing immediately after the verdict only angered his people and caused a plummet in his approval rating. And now the Russian president, who was an important ally, was pressuring him to make a new statement calling for order and an end to the rioting. 
 
 So the Prime Minister assembled his top security aides and told them to secure a spot in a nearby park. He would then make an announcement calling for an end to the violence once and for all. 
 
 A sizable crowd assembled as he made his speech. But he was confident that there would not be any incidents. 
 
 Unfortunately, a sniper's bullet would soon disprove that confidence.

 Yusuf Hajadi wanted to make a statement. His terrorist group had dominated the civil war that erupted following the Prime Minister's assassination. And now that his Nationalist People's Party had established a new dictatorial system of government in Bhutaristan, he was going to make sure that no other nation, no matter how big and powerful, was going to push him around. 
 
 Hajadi summoned the Minister of the Military. `` What's the status of our'special purchase'?'' 
 
 `` We have secured the missiles. There's about fifty of them... all with potent nuclear warheads. The sellers took good care of them ever since they were in Soviet hands.'' 
 
 `` Good. Make sure the storage bunker is ready for them. And as soon as one of them is ready, we're going to send it over to the devils in America.'' 
 
 `` What?! Are you mad???? The Americans will annihilate us! And the Russians will take our land afterwards!'' 
 
 `` We'll make it look like the Russians did it. I want a missile silo built right by the border. I will tell the Transportation minister to start a huge tunnel project so that we can build this without any spy satellites noticing. Then, once the missile is ready, we launch it at the Americans!'' 
 
 `` You're insane. I will not stand for this!'' 
 
 Hajadi motioned to one of the guards. He pulled a knife and slit the minister's throat. 
 
 `` You are my new Minister of the Military,'' he said to the guard as the former minister fell dead. `` Get started on the silo!'' 
 
 `` As you wish, my leader.'' 
 
 Hajadi smiled. `` This will be a glorious day for Bhutaristan!''

 A rogue missile, detonating thirty miles off the coast of Virginia Beach. Hundreds of thousands dead, and a metropolis nearly obliterated. 
 
 A provocation leading to U.S. forces invading Bhutaristan and deposing of their maniacal leader. 
 
 A retaliatory invasion of Bhutaristan by Russia, angry at the prolonged occupation of the land by U.S. forces, further incinerating an already heated conflict in the area, as nations all over the world are forced to take sides. 
 
 No one wanted to call this `` World War III'' at first. But as China and Iran joined Russia, and NATO forces joined the Americans, in the struggle for the soul of Bhutaristan, everyone came to the grim realization that this was indeed a global battle, though concentrated in one region of the globe. 
 
 After three years of heavy fighting, there may be a stalemate and an end to the war in the near future. But the human toll, although merely a tiny fraction of the previous world war, is still devastating to some. 
 
 One casualty of war is Philip Nailer, an Army Sergeant, who was struck by enemy gunfire as he led a group of Bhutari schoolchildren to safety. 
 
 His ultimate sacrifice was a valiant one, that saved a dozen young lives. But his father is still wracked with grief and guilt as he is presented with his son's medal during the funeral. 
 
 Says his father, Roland Nailer: `` Sometimes I feel like I'm the one who started this horrible war in the first place.''
